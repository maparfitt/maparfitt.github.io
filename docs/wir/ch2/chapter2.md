# Active Reading

>“Curiously enough, one cannot read a book: one can only reread it. A good reader, a major reader, an active and creative reader is a rereader." Vladimir Nabokov

When you have to write about a difficult text, you face a special challenge. Your task is not just to get through the reading, or even to come up with ideas about it, but to meet the author’s ideas and develop a response that is adequate to them — “adequate” in its root sense: equal, commensurate, or fitting, having been brought up to the same level. A careless reading cannot lead to a response that is equal to the text, one that recognizes and respects the text’s mean- ing. At the same time, the reader who is concerned only with the text’s meaning and does no more than repeat or summarize the main point will not truly be respond- ing to the text at all and will have nothing to say that another reader might find interesting or useful. The real challenge, then, of response is twofold: to compre- hend the text’s meaning and to respond with fresh and interesting ideas. Active reading strategies help you accomplish both of these tasks. This chapter offers some basic strategies — strategies you should consider using whenever you read a text you will have to write about. The next chapter offers some additional strategies for active reading, ones you can draw on more selectively and which will help you dig deeper into an argument; these are useful when you have to work with an espe- cially difficult or complicated text or when an assignment requires you to explore a text’s argument very closely.

As we noted in the last chapter, in practice understanding a text and responding to it cannot be separated into completely distinct activities — they inevitably overlap — yet first readings tend to focus more on comprehending, and later read- ings more on responding. You may need to read a difficult text three times or more before you feel comfortable writing about it. This is not unusual, and in fact many students find that this kind of close, deep work with a writer’s ideas — pondering them, questioning them, wrestling with them—is among the most rewarding kinds of academic experience.

So plan to read a text several times if you will be writing in response to it. Though more than three readings may be needed, the process typically has three phases.

- The first reading allows you to get your bearings — to get a general sense of the sort of text you are dealing with and the work that lies ahead.
- The second reading usually provides a better sense of how the pieces fit together into a whole, and now you can begin to map the text’s argument or structure so that you arrive at a strong sense of “the lay of the land.”
- On the third and subsequent readings, you define, clarify, and strengthen a position of your own.

Although at first the text may feel like a wilderness, if you take the time to explore, survey, and map it, you can soon feel at home in it. With the help of a few strategies, you can approach this kind of work with confidence and even a sense of adventure.

## Reading through the Text for the First Time

### Read from Beginning to End
The principal aim of a first reading is to develop a general sense of the text as a whole, to “get your bearings,” so that when you begin to concentrate on discrete passages, you will be able to use your understanding of the whole to make sense of them. In this first reading, try to push on from the beginning to the end of the essay or chapter with minimal interruptions and without worrying too much about passages whose meaning is not immediately clear. Focus on the main argument, and try to follow the thread that runs through the whole text, connecting paragraph to paragraph and section to section. Glance at footnotes or endnotes, but don’t let them distract you from this thread. If for a moment you lose your sense of how the pieces are fitting together, don’t get discouraged. Keep reading. Later passages may help to clarify earlier passages, and examples and anecdotes may help to make sense of abstract generalizations. But for now, you need only get a sense of the “shape” of the text, the principal features of the landscape. As you read, keep an eye out for the author’s main purpose and argument so that later you can confidently identify it.

### Keep a Notebook and Pen Nearby
It’s always a good policy to keep a notebook and pen nearby so that you can mark up the reading or write notes if the need arises or inspiration strikes — and if it does, go ahead and write, even if it means interrupting your reading for a few minutes. (Of course, you can also use a computer for your writing.) Capture your thoughts and put them into words while they are fresh. The value of this kind of informal and unstructured writing is immeasurable, and, we contend, “freewriting” at various stages of the reading and drafting process is essential to a good final product. Its purpose is not only to record your thoughts; the very act of writing helps to clarify and develop them and to begin a conversation with the text. Your thoughts may be tentative, random, and sketchy at first, but that should not discourage you. The pro- cess of thinking things through on paper is valuable even when the writing itself turns out to be no more than a stepping-stone to more usable writing later on.

### Mark Up the Text
A brand-new book, with its crisp pages and clean margins, is an object you may want to keep in mint condition. But textbooks are not coffee-table books. They are the tools of your education, and writing in them does not desecrate them. For cen- turies, readers have annotated — or marked up — books with notes and made their copies into unique records of a thoughtful engagement with the author’s ideas. (Notes in the margins of a book are known as marginalia.) “Annotation,” writes H. J. Jackson in Marginalia: Readers Writing in Books, “used to be taught as part of the routine of learning. Marking, copying out, inserting glosses, selecting heads, adding bits from other books, and writing one’s own observations are all traditional devices, on a rising scale of readerly activity, for remembering and assimilating text.”1 Owning a book allows you to record your conversation with the author; that conversation begins with your choice of what to underline and what to jot down in the margins. (See Figure 2.1.) Some readers develop their own private codes for marginal notes, using math symbols, abbreviations, and pictographs. Your notes in the margins make a book more completely your own.

But on reading a text for the first time, avoid marking it up too heavily. Instead read through the text completely at a steady pace, knowing that later on you’ll come back to it and mark it up thoughtfully.

Underline sparingly — just key phrases or sentences that you know you will want to come back to; and in the margins, jot down a question mark next to puz- zling passages, or a brief keyword as a heading, and so on. When you reread and have a stronger sense of the shape of the argument as a whole, you will mark up the text more heavily (see p. 00). For this kind of work, a thick highlighter marker may be better than nothing, but in the long run it reveals its shortcomings. After several rereadings, devotees of the highlighter often end up with a text so heavily highlighted that nothing stands out any longer in the great sea of yellow or pink—and so it defeats its purpose. A pencil or a fine-point pen, on the other hand, offers plenty of flexibility — underlining; circling words or phrases; writing words, symbols, and simple diagrams in the margins; and so on — and allows you to mark up pages and write notes in a notebook without constantly switching between tools.

Here is an example of annotations a student made during a first reading. This is the first paragraph of Adam Gopnik’s essay “Bumping into Mr. Ravioli.” (The full piece is reprinted on p. 000.)
    
    7 1⁄2 years old
My daughter, Olivia, who just turned three, has an imaginary friend whose name is Charlie Ravioli. Olivia is growing up in Manhattan, and so Charlie Ravioli has a lot of local traits: he lives in an apartment “on Madison and Lexington,” he dines on grilled chicken, fruit, and water, and, having reached the age of seven and a half, he feels, or is thought, “old.” But the most peculiarly local thing about Olivia’s imag- inary playmate is this: he is always too busy to play with her. She holds her toy cell phone up to her ear, and we hear her talk into it: “Ravioli? It’s Olivia . . . It’s Olivia. Come and play? OK. Call me. Bye.” Then she snaps it shut and shakes her head. “I always get his machine,” she says. Or she will say, “I spoke to Ravioli today.” “Did you have fun?” my wife and I ask. “No. He was busy working. On a televi- sion” (leaving it up in the air if he repairs electronic devices or has his own talk show).

Here are the annotations of the same paragraph that the student made during a second reading. Note that he has expanded his use of marginalia.

On a televi- sion” (leaving it up in the air if he repairs electronic devices or has his own talk show).

### Note the Knowledge Problem, Thesis Statement, and Key Claims
As you read, look for an explanation — even a very compressed one — of the knowl- edge problem that the author is addressing—the question that remains unan- swered, the mystery that remains unsolved, or the need that remains unfilled. As we noted in Chapter 1, scholars typically identify the important unknowns in their field and attempt to contribute something large or small toward answering these knowledge problems. Usually, scholars tell the reader quite early in the article the nature of the problem, question, or need they are addressing. However, since they are often writing for other specialists in their field, they may refer to this problem in shorthand, with a brief allusion rather than a full explanation. Still, if you look care- fully in the first few paragraphs, you can usually find at least a hint of it. And recog- nizing the knowledge problem will help you understand the author’s main purpose and the general direction of the argument.

Closely linked to the problem is the thesis statement: a proposition, in one or two sentences, that stands for the argument of the text as a whole. You might think of the thesis as the author’s answer to the knowledge problem—perhaps just a small part of the answer, but something worth contributing to the conversation about this problem. Writers do not always position the thesis statement at the end of the first paragraph, as you may have learned to do, but it usually does appear somewhere near the beginning of the essay or somewhere near the end. Writers will sometimes restate a thesis in different forms as their argument evolves; for example, a short version might appear at the beginning of the essay, and a more detailed one at the end. Many accomplished writers resist following predictable formulas, so they might decide to hold the reader in suspense and disclose the argument a little later than expected, or they may want to begin with a lengthier introduction that makes it necessary to place the thesis statement in the fourth or fifth paragraph rather than in the first or second. A complex argument may even require breaking the thesis statement into several parts that appear throughout the essay. So be on the lookout not only for the thesis statement but for all state- ments that disclose the author’s sense of the purpose and direction of the argument.

As you work your way through an argument, you may notice that it contains interlocking parts: one argument has to be made to support another argument, and each argument or supporting argument works together with others to make the author’s overall case for the thesis. Each argument contains one or more claims (assertions) and support for those claims (see pp. 000–000.). As you read, identify the major arguments and their claims — you will often find them at or near the beginning of paragraphs. Notice also how the author supports such claims—perhaps through stories, or with data, or by referring to the work of other researchers. Not all essays make straightforward arguments in support of a thesis, however; some are much more exploratory and questioning (see Adam Gopnik’s “Bumping into Mr. Ravioli,” p. 000, and Geoff Dyer’s “Blues for Vincent,” p. 000, for example.)

### Note Divisions, Turning Points, and Signposts
Whether you’re reading an exploratory essay or a thesis-driven argument, note and mark the major divisions in the text; where the author shifts from one topic or theme to another; and how each topic or theme relates to the thesis of the essay as a whole. If necessary, write headings in the margins.

Many writers leave signposts for the reader at key turning points in the text. These signposts may be a single word such as “however” or “nevertheless” that reveals a shift in the direction of the argument, perhaps to introduce some excep- tion or qualification. But sometimes an author very explicitly states where we will be heading or where we have come from, perhaps using a phrase like “I will argue that . . . ” or “Having demonstrated that . . . ” This kind of writing (sometimes called metadiscourse) often helps the reader take a step back from the details of an argu- ment to get a stronger sense of its general direction, or it reminds the reader of the global argument after a long detour. Statements like these often appear at turning points in the text. Consider an example from an influential essay by the historian Frederick Jackson Turner, “The Significance of the Frontier in American History” (1893). Because his essay is necessarily full of facts and references that support his argument, he wants the reader to be able to navigate through the wealth of detail and still keep sight of the destination, so he offers an entire paragraph at about the midpoint that functions as a large signpost.

Having now roughly outlined the various kinds of frontier, and their modes of advance, chiefly from the point of view of the frontier itself, we may next inquire what were the influences on the East and on the Old World. A rapid enumeration of some of the more noteworthy effects is all that I have time for.2

2 Frederick Jackson Turner, The Significance of the Frontier in American History (New York: Ungar, 1985), 44.

This kind of metadiscourse is “programmatic” — it reveals the author’s project — and reassures the reader that the vessel is still on course and that the destination is just over the horizon. In any complicated or difficult reading, these signposts are worth looking out for and worth marking or underlining so that you can come back to them whenever you need a reminder.

### Note Things That Puzzle You
At this stage, your first reading, don’t spend a lot of time trying to figure out every- thing in the text you find confusing. Simply make a note in the margin of things that you’ll want to come back to later on, or copy out a brief phrase from the text and a page number, so that you can identify the passage easily. In one or two sentences, write down your question, as clearly as you can at this stage, or simply put a ques- tion mark next to the passages you don’t understand.

## Mark Up the Text
Read Rana Foroohar’s essay “What Ever Happened to Upward Mobility?” (p. 000) steadily from beginning to end, marking up the text as you go. Follow the lines offered above, as best you can. Mark or underline Foroohar’s statement of the problem, her thesis statement, and some of her key claims. (If on a first reading you cannot identify all those elements, simply make a note of those you need to keep looking for as you reread.) Identify divisions, turning points, and signposts in the essay. And note anything that puzzles or surprises you — as well as anything you find especially interesting or thought provoking. Finally, in the margins or on a separate page, gloss unfamiliar terms and references.

### Gloss Unfamiliar References
As noted earlier, one of the most effective and efficient ways of making better sense of a text is to look up unfamiliar words (and familiar words that seem to be used in unfamiliar ways) in a college-level dictionary. Many e-book devices allow a high- lighted word to be looked up in a built-in or online dictionary. It is also useful to look up unfamiliar allusions and references, either in a traditional encyclopedia or on the Internet. A quick Web search can provide context.

A gloss is an explanatory note that a reader records in the margins of a text or in a separate notebook. Instead of interrupting your reading every few minutes, however, consider using a code to mark unfamiliar terms, and look up several at once when you reach a convenient break in the text. For example, you might underline and put a “d” in the margins next to words you need to look up in the dictionary, and underline and put an “a” in the margin next to unfamiliar allusions or references.

Every reader encounters the problem of changing cultural knowledge. Culture changes constantly, and readers today tend to be much less familiar with, say, the Bible or Greek myths or even Shakespeare’s plays than were readers of just a few decades ago. Writers once took for granted that readers would understand allu- sions to “Niobe’s tears,” for example, or “the patience of Job.” Today, readers may not recognize the source or immediately catch the meaning, but they can easily look such things up on the Internet. Try Encyclopedia.com or one of the reference works at Bartleby.com (bartleby.com/reference).

## Reading Journal: Thoughts, Claims, and Questions

Keep a reading journal, either in a notebook reserved for this purpose or in a spe- cial folder on your computer. You’ll want to be able to review your entries easily, so it’s important to keep them together in one place. In your first entry, include three parts: your first thoughts, a list of two or three important claims that you noticed in the text, and a list of two or three good questions about the text.

Don’t be too concerned about the quality of your work at this point; you need only lay the groundwork for more productive writing you’ll do later on. But this groundwork is valuable, as a word or phrase that might seem insignificant now can inspire an important insight later.

### Record Your First Thoughts

After reading the whole text once, put it aside and spend at least ten minutes writ- ing freely and unreservedly about what you’ve just read. First, note the date and time at the top of the page or document. Then write continuously; don’t stop to worry about grammar, spelling, word choice, or even whether your thoughts are any good. This freewriting is for your eyes only—a chance simply to record your initial response to the text, however basic or incoherent. Here are some questions you might ask yourself if you’re stuck — remember, though, that there are no firm rules for this, and you certainly don’t have to cover all (or any) of these questions.
- What is the text about? How would you describe the author’s main purpose, as you understand it at this point?
- Of everything you just read, what most stands out in your memory?
- What do you think of the author’s ideas at this point?
- What was it like to read this text? Hard work? Easy going? Stimulating? Arduous? Describe the experience.
- How do you feel you performed as a reader? (Note your strengths as well as your weaknesses.)

### Record Your Initial Response in a Journal Entry

If you have not already done so, read Rana Foroohar’s “What Ever Happened to Upward Mobility?” (p. 000) once from beginning to end. Then put it aside and spend ten to fifteen minutes writing in a journal, either on paper or on a computer. First record the date and time at the top of the page, and then write freely and continuously. If you get stuck or feel unsure of your direction, turn to the ques- tions listed in the “Record Your First Thoughts” section (p. 000). At some point
in your writing, attempt to express in your own words the essence of the problem that Foroohar is addressing. In addition, try to record from memory two or three of the claims that she makes. And note two or three questions about the text that occurred to you as you were reading or that occur to you now. (You need not do all these steps in any particular order. The main thing is simply to record your initial responses to the text.)

Here’s an example of one student’s initial response after reading Rana Foroohar’s “What Ever Happened to Upward Mobility?” (p. 000).

### Student Sample Reading Journal, First Entry
>March 31, 2015, 8:20 p.m.
>I was pretty surprised by the things I learned from this essay, as I’d always thought of the USA as “the land of opportunity.” But I guess things have been changing in the last few decades, and even if “our national mythology,” as Foroohar calls it, was more than just myth 40 years ago, it seems to be less so today. >The big question for me, though, is whether the trends that Foroohar discusses can be reversed. I suppose that’s what she’s getting at by “inflection point”: we might still be able to change direction before it’s too late. Some of the things Foroohar mentions seem like they may be temporary effects of the financial crisis, but other things, such as tax policies and social safety nets seem like they’re not going to change without a lot of effort. I don’t have a problem with social safety nets or fairer tax policies, but I do suspect that super-high taxes would make it harder to start a small business or save for college. I think Americans like the idea of risk more than people in other countries, too. I think they like the idea that they’re taking care of themselves, not just letting the government take care of them. Of course, they also like the idea of climbing the economic ladder, so if Foroohar’s right, we have some work to do. I’m just not sure we need to become exactly like the European countries. I think I understood this essay pretty well, though there are lots of facts to absorb and lots of issues to think about, so it wouldn’t hurt to read it again.

### Identify the Problem (If Possible)
If you can, explain in your own words the nature of the problem that the author is concerned with, or as much about it as you can grasp at this point. In some instances, this may be difficult after only one reading; if so, simply write a word or two reminding you to come back to this step after a rereading or two.

### Restate Two or Three Claims
Next, identify from memory two or three of the author’s claims. If you can confi- dently identify one of these claims as the author’s thesis, then do so. (Perhaps mark a capital “T” next to it in the margin.) But if you’re not sure of the thesis yet, don’t worry: the claims you identify at this point need not be the most important ones, just ones that you recall. But try to be sure that they are indeed claims — arguable propositions — and not simple statements of fact.

### Ask Two or Three Questions
Finally, write down two or three good questions about the text. A “good” question is simply a genuine question about some aspect of the text that interests or puzzles you — the sort of question you’d like to raise in a discussion and that might lead to a deeper understanding of the text, or some aspect of it, rather than a merely fac- tual question with a yes/no answer or a “quiz” question that would only be asked to make sure the class had done its homework.

## Rereading
### Read Slowly
To some, this may not sound like a productive reading strategy; we tend to assume that, as the ads for speed-reading courses tell us, better readers are faster readers. But in fact, good readers vary their pace to suit their purpose and the nature of the material. They might skim quickly through a newspaper article or a Web page, but they will take the time to absorb, weigh, and ponder a densely argued text, espe- cially if they expect to be writing or talking about it. Read at a pace that’s com- fortable, but don’t hurry. Especially for your second and subsequent readings, you’ll get much more out of a text if you give it the time it requires.

### Develop Your Marginalia
Your most important task is to identify the author’s argument and follow it through- out the text. To do so, you will need to mark up the text more heavily. If you don’t have a lot of margin space (or are unwilling to mark up your book even with a pen- cil), consider making a photocopy of the essay so that you can use the larger mar- gins as well as the white space on the reverse. Or you might attach Post-it notes to the book; one advantage of this approach is that, by aligning the edge of each note with the edge of the page, you can easily locate your notes later, and of course you can detach them if needed. If you’re working with an electronic text, consider print- ing it out so that you can annotate it by hand. Or you can use an app such as iAnnotate and or a Web-based tool such as Crocodoc to mark up and add mar- ginalia to any electronic text.

### A Basic Dialectical Notebook
The dialectical notebook is a simple and powerful method of taking notes devel- oped by Ann E. Berthoff.3 Here’s how it works. Draw a line down the center of a page in your notebook. You can also use a computer. At the top of the left-hand column, write “What It Says.” Here, you’ll take notes about what the author is saying. These might be quotations of key phrases, whole sentences, or even whole paragraphs. They might be paraphrases or summaries of parts of the text. Or they might outline a section of the text. The form they take is up to you — but the left side of the page belongs to the author’s words and ideas. (Be sure to record the page number that corresponds to each quotation or paraphrase so that you can find it and cite it later.) At the top of the right-hand column, write “What I Think.” Here, you’ll take notes about what you think about what the author is saying. These notes might consist of comments, questions, reactions, reflections, or even symbols and punc- tuation marks (!, ?, *, huh?). They can be as long or as short as you like. At first, your notes on the right side may be quite brief compared to those on the left, but it’s important to write something on the “What I Think” side. In particular, write down your questions. The act of formulating your questions in words will help make them clearer and more definite. You can come back to them and rephrase them more precisely later on. You’ll be able to try out possible answers to these questions and find patterns that will help you see things that were hidden before.
The word “dialectic” refers to a method of arriving at insights through debate, discussion, or an exchange of ideas. The double-entry format of the dialectical notebook lets you keep one foot in the text, so to speak, and one foot in your own reactions to it. This close and continuous interaction with the text produces a dia- lectic that, like good talk, leads somewhere. But you’ve got to keep up your end of the conversation. The notes you take on the right, notes that record and develop what is going on in your head as you reread, may be different from the sort of notes you usually take. Berthoff described this record-keeping as an audit of meaning. An audit is a methodical review or examination. Recording your responses, and then reviewing them and recording your responses to your responses, is the key to establishing a real dialogue with the text. This dialogue, as Berthoff argues, is the essence of critical reading and writing: “The reason for the double-entry notebook will become apparent to you as you begin to see that you are conducting the con- tinuing audit of meaning that is at the heart of learning to write critically.”4 This method of note-taking may seem time-consuming, but it helps to generate critical reading and ideas for writing so effectively that it is worth giving it a try.

4 Berthoff, Forming/Thinking/Writing, 27.

If initially you have very little on the right side of the page, reread with the sole aim of recording your responses, however vague or inarticulate they might be at this early stage. Then work through your notes and write brief responses to the quotations and paraphrases that you noted on the left — as many of them as you can. If you’re at a loss, use these questions as prompts.
- Why did this passage seem noteworthy or puzzling to you?
- What can you say about its meaning?
- What questions can you ask about the passage?
- If the passage is confusing, can you identify where the difficulty lies? For example, is there a particular word, phrase, or sentence structure that is unclear?
- How might you connect this passage to something else in the text, or to other texts in the course, or to your own knowledge or experience?
Don’t worry at this point about whether your thoughts are impressive or essay- worthy or “right.” You can edit later, and you can use as much or as little of these dialectical notes in your final product as you like. For now, they need only be a record of your own thoughts as you read.

### Layers: The Dialectical Notebook as Palimpsest
The real power of the dialectical notebook becomes clear when you start working over the notes that you took on a first and second reading. With each subsequent reading, you can build up the notes on each side, and as they become denser and more fully developed, you can begin working solely with your notebook, amplifying and elaborating your thoughts until you have whole sentences and paragraphs, ref- erenced to relevant passages in the text. For example, on a first reading, you might copy out on the left side a passage you found especially puzzling, and on the right write down nothing more than two question marks next to it. But on a second read- ing, some ideas about the meaning of the passage may occur to you, and so you jot them down. Returning to this page later, you might realize that your ideas were basically right but that you can now explicate the text with more confidence and more precision, so you edit your notes and add to them. (You might want to write or type each layer of notes in a different color, so that you can later distinguish first- impression notes from subsequent notes.)

In this way, your notes develop layers, and your pages become a kind of “palimpsest.” This word derives from a Greek root that literally means “scraped again.” Before the invention of paper, writing surfaces were expensive and were often reused rather than thrown out. A palimpsest is a manuscript of papyrus or parchment from which the text has been scraped away, but not completely erased, to make room for a new layer, so that the first layer is still legible beneath. By exten- sion, the word is often used to refer to a text that bears more than one layer of writ- ing, one superimposed on another. In our case, the first layer of writing will not be erased to make room for a new layer, but rather serves as a foundation for subse- quent layers that fill in the white space around it.

The three examples that follow provide a glimpse of a student actively using this method of note-taking. These cumulative entries on Rana Foroohar’s “What Ever Happened to Upward Mobility?” (p. 000) show the student’s newest notes in blue.

“sclerotic”? (p. 000) ABSOLUTE mobility
how much growth has occurred RELATIVE mobility
how you’re doing compared to other people (climbing ladder)
“Nordic nations”
In Europe: more equality, more homogeneous pops.
“When the rungs on the ladder are further apart, it’s harder to climb up them.” (Sawhill)
(Isabel Sawhill, Brookings Institution’s Center on Children & Families)
“Gilded Age”
Role of banking and finance industry
WHAT I THINK:
Is this just a temporary thing? Or likely to be permanent?
Impossible to know? How can it be reversed? Become more like Europe?
5 “becoming rigid and unresponsive” But doesn’t this suggest we’re all
getting richer together? Complicated.
Why is relative mobility a good thing? Isn’t absolute really better?
5 what countries exactly?
More socialist or welfare state systems in Europe. But still, U.S. should give more mobility.
Meaning that the spread between wealth and poverty is greater in the U.S.
? 5 1870–1900, roughly, when some Americans got very rich (Wikipedia)
Inequality is a problem, I guess, but if everyone’s wealth could increase, not such a big problem, maybe?

### Creating a Dialectical Notebook
You can set up a dialectical notebook on paper or on your computer. Divide the page down the middle and give each column the appropriate headings: “What It Says” on the left and “What I Think” on the right. (If you’re using a computer, you can insert two text boxes side by side to create two columns. This takes a few minutes, but you can save the blank dialectical notebook template for future use.) Read or reread your assigned essay with your dialectical notebook open, and take notes in the “What It Says” column as you go. Respond to these notes in the “What I Think” column. Leave some space so that you can develop these notes later. (For further detail, see “A Basic Dialectical Notebook,” p. 00.)

After reading and making notes once, read through the text a second time and develop your notes with a second layer. Record new insights and observations, and pay special attention to any notes on the right-hand side that suggest an idea, a question, or a puzzlement that needs to be worked out. Respond to your earlier responses, so that your notebook begins to become an audit of meaning.

### Reading Journal: Further Thoughts
After you’ve finished rereading, spend twenty to thirty minutes with your reading journal. The purpose is to give you an opportunity to collect your thoughts while the reading is still fresh in your mind, to develop these thoughts by the act of writ- ing (remember: writing tends to generate ideas, not just record them), and to cap- ture some words or phrases that might be useful later. You’ve already laid the groundwork with your entries in your dialectical notebook: this is an opportunity to begin building on it — in a very rudimentary way, perhaps, but you never know what might happen. The point is to give your mind the opportunity to create thoughts.

Here is what one student, Stephanie Skinner, wrote in her journal after reading Foroohar’s essay and working with her dialectical notebook. Note how she has begun to shape and structure her observations.

### Student Sample Reading Journal, Second Entry
After reading Foroohar again, I think I’m persuaded that America has a problem, and we need to make sure that more people have real opportunity in their lives and that the gap between the haves and the have-less isn’t quite as crazy wide as it is right now. But maybe this means getting back to where we were a few decades ago rather than imitating European countries. Foroohar admits that those societies are different from ours, smaller and less diverse (for a start). I think I would argue that our model ought to be the America of 1960 or 1970 rather than the Sweden of today. I realize that we can’t simply turn back the clock: values have changed and technology has changed and the rest of the world has changed. (For example, women aren’t going to quit their jobs in droves and become homemakers; the Internet isn’t going to go away.) But we could try to manufacture more products
in America, and we could do more to make homes affordable, I think. I’ll need to make a list of the things that were different 40 or 50 years ago in America and see which things might be restored and which things can’t or probably shouldn’t.

### Timed Freewriting
First, spend another ten minutes writing continuously in your reading journal. Again, don’t be too concerned with the quality of your writing. But focus this time on what you are now able to say about the text, beyond what you could say after the first reading. How has your understanding of the text changed? Did you notice any- thing different or new this time through? What are your thoughts now about the author’s argument?

### Two or Three More Claims
Write down from memory two or three more of the author’s claims, ones that you overlooked the first time. This will give you a more complete sense of the author’s argument.

### Respond to Your First Questions
Take a look at the questions you wrote down after your first reading. Can you respond to any of them now? If so, write a paragraph or two.

### Write Down Two More Questions
Add two more questions to your entry. Perhaps you’ll find this time that your ques- tions are even more penetrating and interesting—that they go deeper into the main concerns of the text.

Of course, you can read the text a third time, or as many times as you wish, and repeat the same process of freewriting, identifying claims, responding to questions, and posing new ones. Beyond providing material you can bring to class discussion, your notebook may well contain good material for your writing too.

## Checklist for Active Reading
Here are some guidelines to help you get the most out of reading a text. Remember: difficult texts are difficult for most readers, and good readers expect to reread.

The first time you read a text, read it through from beginning to end.

<input type="checkbox" name="markup"> <label for="markup">Mark up the text.</label>

- Underline and make marginal notes — but sparingly.
- Keep a notebook and pen nearby.
- Note key claims, turning points, and signposts.
- Note things that puzzle you.
- Gloss unfamiliar references.

<input type="checkbox" name="journal"> <label for="journal">Keep a reading journal.</label>
