# Organizing the Essay
## Thinking Like a Reader

>It’s part of my feeling that what a writer does is to try to make sense of life. I think that’s what writing is. . . . It’s seeking that thread of order and logic in the disorder, and the incredible waste and marvelous profligate character of life. What all artists are trying to do is to make sense of life. NADINE GORDIMER

If you have drafted and perhaps revised an introductory paragraph, some body paragraphs, and a concluding paragraph, you already have the beginnings of an organizational plan for your essay. But at  this point it is a good idea to spend some time refining the organization to give your ideas the most effective arrangement possible. (See the workflow charts on pp. 000 and 000.)

Organization is most apparent to a reader when it is lacking; good organiza- tion is transparent. The reader of a well-organized essay simply proceeds steadily through the argument, admiring how one thought flows smoothly and logically into another and how every question seems to be answered as soon as it arises. The sequence of ideas seems natural, inevitable, even obvious. On occasion, writers achieve this sense of easy flow without effort: the order in which the ideas spilled out onto the page turns out to be the right and best order. But most of the time, writers must give careful thought to the best way to arrange ideas and organize paragraphs. They must work hard to make the organization seem natural and inevitable.

No two essays are organized exactly alike, and no simple formula exists for organizing an essay, because if the writer has anything new to say, the essay will be unique. Organization should be organic in the sense that it should suit the particular subject matter, serve the writer’s purpose, and meet the needs of the occasion. (The word “organize,” from the Greek word organon, meaning “a tool of thought,” suggests not just an orderly structure but one that suits its purpose.) So organizing an essay requires some craftsmanship; arguments cannot simply be squeezed into a one-size-fits-all mold, such as the five-paragraph essay format you may have learned in high school or middle school. This format may function well as training wheels—for learning basic principles of argument and para- graph structure — but it lacks the necessary flexibility for the more complicated arguments that college instructors expect. Professional scholars and writers do not employ the five-paragraph format because their ideas can almost never be distilled into just three body paragraphs. Every argument must take its own par- ticular shape, filling as many paragraphs as it requires. The number depends on the nature of the argument.

Organizing your essay is not just a question of arranging ideas; it’s also a mat- ter of revealing that arrangement to your reader. So let’s first consider some key principles of organization. Following that, we’ll consider some strategies for orga- nizing essays, especially longer and more complex ones.
