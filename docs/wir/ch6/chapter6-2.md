## Organizing an Argument Essay
A well-crafted essay follows certain basic principles of organization. These are principles rather than rules because variations are certainly permissible (and some- times advisable, as we shall see later). But even when straying from them, be sure to keep these principles in mind.

### Keep Your Own Argument in the Foreground
The first principle of essay organization is to keep the argument in the foreground; that is, make the argument clear at the outset and keep it prominent throughout the essay. Here are some techniques (again, these are not rigid rules).

Place a Well-Crafted Thesis Statement Near the Beginning of the Essay — Usually toward the End of the Introduction. This is where readers expect to find the thesis statement, because the purpose of an introductory paragraph (or paragraphs) is usually to explain the essay’s purpose and set the stage for the argu- ment that follows. You may state your thesis again, in different words and perhaps in greater detail, at the end of the essay; however, postponing it entirely could be disastrous if it forces your reader to struggle through the entire essay without grasping your purpose.
Place the Topic and the Claim at the Beginning of the Paragraph. (See Chapter 5, pp. 000–00, for a discussion of the placement of topics and claims.) The first one or two sentences tend to govern the paragraph as a whole because readers expect sentences to indicate the paragraph’s topic and to contain the claim. If the paragraph ends up being about something unrelated to the first couple of sen- tences, readers may become confused. Since complex arguments often require complex supporting evidence—data, reasoning, quotations, claims that support other claims, and so on—readers can easily lose sight of the main point while working through all the details. Placing the claim at the beginning of the paragraph (in the first or second sentence) establishes its importance and shows that the mat- ter that follows is its support.

Create Links between Claims and the Thesis. Use key words and phrases that link back to your thesis statement to show how new arguments connect to the essay’s main purpose. Do this thoughtfully and creatively, however, to avoid a tire- some repetition of the same words and phrases throughout. To give yourself a vari- ety of terms and phrases to choose from, take a few minutes to list five or six different ways of expressing your main point. These need not be full sentences; you need just a small storehouse of words and phrases for you to draw from as you revise.

For example, a student writer of an essay arguing that human rights should not be extended to the great apes listed the following connected terms and phrases:
- rights,privileges,entitlements,protections
- recognize, enshrine, preserve, respect
- human being, person, animal, nonhuman animal, primate, ape, great ape
- difference, distinction, contrast

In the end, the writer did not use all these words, but having them on hand made it easier to forge varied and appropriate links between claim sentences and the main argument.

Separate Out Claims and Develop Each Argument Fully
An expository essay (one that explains an idea or makes an argument) must lay out a line of thinking in a systematic and reasonably complete way, making it possible for the reader to weigh the ideas fairly. It exposes the whole argument to the reader’s view. A common weakness in such essays is a failure to explicate the argument thoroughly, to spell out the component parts and support each one adequately. (The problem, of course, is that the writer is already so familiar with the argument that he or she forgets to explain crucial elements in it.) A good argument essay does not merely state the thesis and the main claims; it also provides evidence for the claims, reasons out the argument, and considers its implications. It addresses as many sides of the issue as possible.

Avoid clumping arguments together or passing over key elements so swiftly that one argument hides behind another. When we first begin to organize an argu- ment in our minds, we need to cluster ideas, chiefly to give us a sense of how the pieces fit together into a whole. But after getting a sense of the argument’s main parts, we usually need to shift focus to how each of these component parts will become a fully developed stage or “chunk” of the essay — a paragraph or a group of paragraphs on closely related topics (sometimes called a stadium; the plural is “sta- dia”). In other words, after ideas have been brought together into clusters, they need to be separated out into individual paragraphs, and each idea needs to be fully developed and articulated.

A good argument answers all the relevant questions that a reader may have and doesn’t leave the reader thinking, “Well, if claims x and y are true, then I suppose the argument would be valid. But I’m not sure that claims x and y are true.” Or, to give a more concrete example: “If it’s true that frequent testing helps students remember material better, and if remembering material is the point of a good education, then I suppose the author is correct: teachers should give more tests. But I’m not sure that those assumptions are true.” It’s the writer’s job to produce the strongest possible reasons for believing that claims x, y, and all the others are true. This often means analyzing each argument or component of an argument for implied but unstated claims, or for stated but unsupported claims, and working out support for them. For each of the claims we make, we must ask ourselves, “Why do I believe this to be true?

## Developing a Claim
Look through the notes, informal writing, argument matrix, and other material that you produced for earlier chapters. Identify one interesting claim of your own, and copy it out at the top of a blank page or word processing document.
Now look through your notes for support for the claim—perhaps a quotation from the text, or evidence of another kind, or your own ideas. List this support under the claim.

Next, generate as much additional support for the claim as you can. You might find other quotations that support it, other evidence, other reasons. Don’t be afraid to go a little overboard as you brainstorm; you can always cut out the weaker supports once you have plenty of material. Ultimately, however, the number of supports doesn’t matter so much as the fact that you have thoroughly considered all the possibilities.

Now develop your material into an argument paragraph. Begin the paragraph with your claim, and explain the support for the claim in the body of the paragraph. Don’t simply list the evidence, however; explain as fully as you can how and why each piece of evidence relates to and supports the main claim.

You may find that your paragraph becomes too long and needs to be split into two or even three paragraphs. That’s fine. Figure out the best places for a break, and incorporate transitional words or phrases to make it clear that the new paragraphs are still focusing on the claim of the first paragraph.

What reasons do I have for making this claim?” Often the reason is another claim, which will need to be supported in a whole new paragraph.

Now, some claims are so well established already, so unlikely to be at all contro- versial, that elaborate support and explanation are unnecessary. Other claims may be more controversial, but, having been persuasively argued by another writer, they can be covered by a citation or a footnote without being exhaustively reargued. But every claim that is essential to the argument needs to be treated fully, in one or more paragraphs.

For example, the sample essay “Human Rights for Apes: A Well-Intentioned Mistake” (p. 000) could conceivably be reduced to this: “Human rights should not be extended to apes and the distinction between apes and humans should be pre- served, both in law and in ethics, because although apes may be in many ways simi- lar to humans, they lack the cultures and belief systems that make the concept of ‘rights’ necessary.” Such an argument would have the merit of being shorter, but what reason would the reader have for believing the writer’s claims? The claims that are being made in this one-sentence version need to be teased out and treated separately, and each must be developed into a sound argument by providing evi- dence that supports it.

### Address the Counterarguments
As we said in Chapter 5 (p. 000), a counterargument is an argument for the oppos- ing side or point of view. You should address counterarguments because they will occur to many readers anyway, and so it is prudent to deal with them. The usual readers of student essays are instructors, who are trained to think critically and are in the habit of scrutinizing arguments for their strengths and weaknesses. Often, in fact, they are already deeply familiar with the debate or conversation that you have entered. You are more likely to persuade your readers if you can refute all of the strongest counterarguments or, if not refute them, can at least show that you have considered them and then explain why you believe your own position is stronger.

Some essays devote more space to addressing counterarguments than to pre- senting the positive side of the argument. This is appropriate when the proposal itself is quite simple and straightforward but when many objections have been voiced against it. For example, an argument in favor of government-funded day care might focus chiefly on the supposed obstacles to it, as there may be general agreement that, if feasible, free day care would be a good thing.

### Addressing Counterarguments
If you completed an argument paragraph or paragraphs for the previous “Try
This” activity, trade your work with a classmate. Read your classmate’s argument carefully and list as many questions and counterarguments as you can, even if you find the argument convincing. (Keep in mind that the ultimate purpose of this exercise is to help make the argument stronger, so you are not really attacking the argument.) Explain your counterarguments as fully as possible. Then exchange papers with your classmate. Using your classmate’s counterarguments, as well as any others that occur to you, write one or two paragraphs that address and refute two or three of the strongest counterarguments. (You might begin these paragraphs with a phrase such as “Some might argue that 

Establish Common Ground with the Reader
In presenting your argument, you don’t want to alienate your reader by seeming too aggressive. You are not trying to score points against an adversary; you’re trying to win over readers to your way of thinking. Remind your readers of the points on which they probably already agree with you. In this way, you get your readers to consent before you introduce more controversial ideas later on. (For more on this kind of rhetoric, see “Using Rogerian Strategies,” p. 000.)

In the sample essay “Human Rights for Apes: A Well-Intentioned Mistake” (p. 000), the writer disagrees with those who argue that human rights should be extended to apes but concedes that apes should be considered as having certain rights — animal rights. He makes this concession in the second paragraph, imme- diately following the thesis statement, in order to put to rest any supposition that he may want to deny any kind of right to apes. In this way, he narrows the scope of his own argument at the outset to the specific question of whether human rights should be extended to apes. And he shows that he is approaching the problem in a fair-minded and reasonable way.
