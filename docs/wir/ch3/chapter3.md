# Further Strategies for Active Reading

>“To read well, that is, to read true books in a true spirit, is a noble exercise, and one that will task the reader more than any exercise which the customs of the day esteem. It requires a training such as the athletes underwent, the steady intention almost of the whole life to this object. Books must be read as deliberately and reservedly as they were written.” Henry David THoreau

The techniques we described in the previous chapter — marking up the text, taking dialectical notes, and keeping a reading journal — are basic tools for active reading, and you’ll probably use at least one of them whenever you read for your courses. But other strategies can be useful in special situations, such as when you need to work with a very difficult text, and these will be the focus of this chapter. Reading about these alternative strategies might inspire you to come up with new ones of your own, ones uniquely suited to your own particular needs and habits as a reader.

In the epigraph to this chapter, the American philosopher and essayist Henry David Thoreau issues a kind of challenge to his reader: to approach reading with real seriousness and dedication — like professional athletes, who push their limits and constantly strive to improve. Perhaps he makes reading sound rather grueling, but another way to look at it is to consider that, like athletes in training, readers do improve with practice and find that the work gets easier over time. At the same time, Thoreau reminds us that the art of reading is one that nobody ever perfects, that every text is in some way unique and poses fresh challenges.

Certainly as a college student, you’ll find that attentive critical reading is something you’ll practice regularly, and you’ll find that your skills as a reader will be stretched and strengthened as you tackle more difficult texts. You’ll learn to adapt your strategies for different purposes, needs, and time frames; you’ll learn what works best for you and for the kinds of courses you’re taking.

You may want to experiment immediately with the strategies described in this chapter, or you may choose to store them away for later. But it’s important to have such tools available when you need to dig into an argument and probe it deeply, questioning it not in a hostile way but to find out whether it stands up to scrutiny. Just as you might have come to know pieces of music intimately by repeated listening, so too can you become as familiar with a text as its author is (as Thoreau suggests readers should do) through a combination of rereading and close critical analysis. The strategies that follow may seem time-consuming, but that’s not a bad thing: spending time with a text and becoming absorbed in it is the surest way to develop your own ideas about it. The common denominator among all these strategies is that they keep the reader focused on the text for the time it takes for those ideas to emerge.

## Variations on the Dialectical Notebook
### A Question-Centered Triple-Entry Notebook
This is another kind of dialectical notebook, one suggested by David Jolliffe in his book *Inquiry and Genre: Writing to Learn in College.*[^1] This method works especially well with texts that take a stand on a debatable issue. As in a double-entry notebook, you audit meanings in the text in one column and your responses to the text in another, but in a third column you also keep an audit of the question or problem that the text addresses. This “question column” helps you focus your responses on the fundamental questions that underlie the argument.

### Guidelines: Taking Double- or Triple-Entry Notes on a Computer
If you prefer to work on your laptop rather than with paper and pen, you can still take notes in parallel columns. If you are working in Microsoft Word or Apple’s Pages, use the “Text Box” tool (in the “Insert” menu) to draw the columns on a blank page. After filling in a heading at the top of each column, save the page as a blank template that you can use repeatedly. (Avoid using the “Columns” command in the “Format” menu, which is designed to make text flow from one column to the next; it does not let you easily move back and forth between the columns.)

To begin a question-centered triple-entry notebook, divide the page into three columns, and give each a heading: “Question” for the left column, “Text’s Answer” for the middle column, and “My Response” for the right column (or your own variation on each heading).
- For the left column, figure out what question each paragraph or section of the text is answering. Usually, the question is only implied, so you’ll need to deduce it. (This can be the most difficult part of the task, but it will give you a strong understanding of how the argument works and of the purpose of each section in relation to the whole.) Expect to write roughly two or three questions per page of text, but you might write more or fewer; there are no strict rules.
- The middle column will note how the text answers the question being addressed.
- The right column will record your own answer to the question being addressed and your thoughts about how the text’s answer squares with your experience and views.

Here is an example of one student’s question-centered triple-entry notes.

### Question-Centered Triple-Entry Notebook
#### THE QUESTION BEING ANSWERED BY THE TEXT
How did we in the 21st century get to be so busy?
How is life in New York particularly affected by these developments?
Should it worry them if Mr. Ravioli has an assistant?
Is the “bump and run” lifestyle that Olivia seems to be imitating so bad after all? Or can it be lived with?

#### HOW GOPNIK ANSWERS THE QUESTION
Trains and telegrams
(p. 000). Trains ended isolation, crowding our streets. The telegram crowded our minds
(p. 000).
Elsewhere, cars and televisions “pulled people apart”—back into a sort of isolation. But in New York, cars and TV watching never caught on to the same extent (p. 000).
Gopnik’s wife thinks so. But Gopnik? Maybe.
In the end, Gopnik seems to be answering “yes, we can live with it”—even though Laurie “threw us badly” (p. 000).
#### MY OBSERVATIONS AND RESPONSE
It’s hard to imagine telegrams crowding a person’s mind, but e-mail and texts certainly do. I’d never thought of it as an issue that dates back to the 19th century.
Yes, okay, but cars and televisions certainly don’t make us feel less busy. Maybe more isolated.
So maybe there is more “bumping into” people
in New York. (Which actually sounds like fun.)
It’s just funny and cute.
Gopnik seems sort of resigned to the inevitable here, and sort of eager to celebrate New York’s lifestyle. I don’t know whether I’m fully convinced, but I agree that busyness has an upside as well as a downside.

### Variations on the Dialectical Notebook
#### A Quotation-Centered Triple-Entry Notebook
This note-taking strategy is a simple but effective method of producing a close reading of key passages in a text, with your own observations and ideas about these passages attached. The simple act of copying out the words forces your attention to stay on the passage and helps to clarify its meaning. This strategy is especially useful when you are working with very difficult texts.

To create a quotation-centered triple-entry notebook, divide your page into three columns, and give each column a heading: “Quotation,” “Exegesis,” and “Commentary” (or, again, variations of your own). An exegesis is an explanation, interpretation, or paraphrase of a passage of text.

- In the left column, copy out a text passage — no more than a few sentences — that seems to you interesting, significant, or puzzling. Take care to copy it exactly. Note the page number so that you can locate the passage in the original text later on.
- In the middle column, write your best explanation of what the passage means. Use only your own words. You may not be confident that you’ve got the meaning quite right, and that’s okay: just get as close as you can.
- In the right column, write down your own observations, ideas, or questions, or any other kind of response. Here you can write freely, comparing the passage with your own experiences and beliefs, or arguing back against the author — whatever you like.
Your exegesis explores inside the text, while your commentary often works from the text to something outside it. Exegesis combined with commentary is a good way to work with dense or difficult texts because it lets you work out the meaning of complicated passages but also requires you to think about their meaning for you. It allows you to move back and forth between the text’s meaning and your meaning. Feel free to write a lot about even a short passage, exploring not only what the passage says but also how the passage says it and what thoughts and feelings the passage suggests. You may be surprised at how much you get out of a passage that might not seem promising at first.

Here is an example of this technique applied to Ralph Waldo’s essay, “The
 American Scholar.”
 
#### QUOTATION
“Man is not a farmer, or a professor, or an engineer, but his is all. Man is priest, and scholar, and statesman, and producer, and soldier” (p. 54).
“Man is thus metamorphosed into a thing, into many things. . . . The priest becomes a form; the attorney, a statute-book; the mechanic, a machine; the sailor a rope of a ship” (p. 54).
“So much of nature as he is ignorant of, so much of his own mind does he not yet possess” (p. 56).
#### EXEGESIS
Man cannot only be one thing. If he focuses only on one aspect of life, he is not a full man and is not a fully functioning member of society.
When you are only focused on one field
of work, you gradually become morphed into that field and are classified by what you do.
Emerson relates the unknowns of nature to the unknowns of human life and experience. Just as we are ignorant of all the nature surrounding us that we must explore, there is still a lot we must explore in our minds as well.
#### COMMENTARY
To be taken seriously, I must show that I
am knowledgeable of many aspects of life. I must be well rounded and educated.
As college students, we are classified by the college we are in the major we want to pursue.
As a college student, I am eager to learn as much as I can while I’m in school. I cannot reject opportunities to learn, and I cannot remain ignorant of all the things going on in the world.

### Adapting the Dialectical Notebook Method
Once you’ve tried some of the dialectical note-taking methods described above, you might begin experimenting with your own versions. For example, some writers like to work with smaller notebooks that are half the size of the standard 8.5-by-11-inch type. In this kind of notebook, you might write your initial notes only on a left-hand page while reading. These notes might be quotations, paraphrases, or reflections. Later, when you review these notes, you can write on the facing page, tying themes together, developing thoughts, sketching out new ideas, and so on. For some writers, a notebook becomes a kind of scrapbook, a repository for all sorts of ideas. They add sticky notes when they run out of space; they incorporate doodles and diagrams; they tape in short articles or images; they use different colored inks to highlight ideas that seem important.

Word processors such as Evernote or Journler and apps such as Noteshelf and Notability work well for keeping this kind of notebook on a laptop or tablet. The medium and even the details of the method are less important than the key principle, however, which is to create an archive of your dialogue with the text, and thus to begin the writing process during the reading process. As Ann E. Berthoff notes,

>In all its phases, composing is conversation you’re having with yourself — or selves, since, when you’re writing, you consciously play the roles of speaker, audience, and critic all at once. You do the talking; then you do the answering; and you listen in to the dialogue between the speaker and the respondent. When you’re making meaning in sentences, gathering sentences to compose paragraphs and paragraphs to construct arguments, you’re doing the same kind of thing you do when you carry on a conversation.[^2]

Ideas can come to us at the strangest moments. Keeping a small notebook with you at all times (or having a suitable app on your phone) will let you work on your ideas when they occur to you — on the subway, in the waiting room of the dentist’s office, or wherever they happen to find you.

## Analyzing the Argument
A good reader will not only follow a text’s argument but also evaluate it and notice its weaknesses and strengths. But arguments can be complicated, and readers sometimes need strategies to help them evaluate an argument fairly and avoid mistakes.
As we have already said, an argument is a kind of logical structure, combining claims and evidence . We produce arguments all the time. “In the long run, my car costs less to drive because it gets twice as many miles per gallon as yours.” The claim: “In the long run, my car costs less to drive.” The evidence: “It gets twice as many miles per gallon as yours.” In this case, the argument is only one sentence long, and the evidence is a single piece of data. The logical structure of this argument is as simple as could be, made up of a premise and a conclusion, a simple “if . . . then” relation. If my car gets twice as many miles per gallon as yours (the premise), then in the long run it would cost less to drive (the conclusion). Of course, a full calculation would have to take in many factors, such as the price of each car and the price of gas; but leaving all that aside for the moment, we have a simple argument.

A more complicated argument — and of course most arguments are a good deal more complicated — will have a more complicated logical structure, combining multiple premises and multiple conclusions. Evidence is rarely a simple statement of fact; often it is itself another claim, and arguments are often complicated structures of claims built on claims. Sometimes claims and evidence can be easily verified with some quick Internet research. But an argument may also be based on some sort of “near fact” that a skeptical reader might question but that is difficult to verify. So arguments can be slippery, and tracing them often demands considerable powers of attention.

Note that this kind of analysis involves thinking about the argument in a different way than we would when reading it simply to understand what it is saying or whether we agree with it. Instead of thinking about what the argument is saying, we’re looking at how the argument is made, how it is constructed. That means putting aside the content of the argument and focusing on its rhetorical structure rather than its subject matter.

Let’s look at Jane McGonigal’s “Be a Gamer, Save the World” (p. 000), a brief opinion column adapted from her book Reality Is Broken. Her thesis is not difficult to grasp, but it’s the kind of argument that’s likely to arouse skepticism in some readers. Analyzing her argument closely will allow us to see more clearly where its strengths and weaknesses lie and may also teach us how to construct stronger arguments of our own.

- Note that in the first paragraph, McGonigal immediately contrasts her own position with conventional wisdom: “We often think . . . ,” she begins, suggesting right away that she will offer a different opinion. She describes the common perception of video games as being harmful to kids or society: video games are seen as a “retreat from reality” and “mind-numbing.” Her own position starkly contradicts this view; she believes that “the truth about games is very nearly the opposite”: they “fulfill genuine human needs” and are “a key resource for solving . . . real-world problems.”

- The second paragraph offers statistics about the prevalence of video games and the size of the industry. Why? McGonigal wants to suggest that video gaming is worthy of our attention, for one thing, but she is also suggesting that such a popular pastime must have some value. She uses the term “alternate reality” for the virtual worlds found in video games, rather than “non-reality” or “false reality.” This will allow her to shift the reader’s perspective on the issue: instead of comparing “virtual reality” to “true reality,” she can compare one kind of world to another and find some positive and negative elements in each.

- The third paragraph spells out the first argument that this shift of perspective makes possible. She upends the conventional wisdom about the “real world” by suggesting that, for these gamers, it’s not the gaming world that’s “missing something” but the ordinary world of physical reality.

- Paragraph four elaborates and supports this idea, making a series of claims (either directly or indirectly through a rhetorical question) about the advantages of experience in the gaming over the ordinary world.

- Paragraph five introduces a new argument, that gamers have an advantage over non-gamers and are starting to use their special skills for “real good.” To support this idea, she cites her own research, which shows that games provide four ingredients for a happy and meaningful life. Subsequent paragraphs will detail the importance of these four ingredients and explain how gaming supplies them.

You can continue this analysis yourself by looking carefully at what McGonigal says in each paragraph and asking questions like: How does the paragraph contribute to the argument? What does it do (as distinct from what it says)? Figuring out the answer is not always easy and can take a bit of time, but it’s an excellent way of learning how arguments work — not in theory but in actual practice.

### What It Says/What It Does
The “What It Says/What It Does” technique is an adaptation of the double-entry notebook that facilitates the kind of rhetorical analysis described above. It helps you separate observations about what each paragraph says (the content) from observations about what it does (how it contributes to the argument’s structure) so that you can then go on to construct an outline of the text’s rhetorical structure. This method may take a little time, but it produces a clear picture of the argument’s main claims and the support for those claims. You will need to approach this kind of analysis in two steps.

- First, analyze each paragraph, and take informal notes on “what it says” and “what it does.” For example, does the paragraph set the stage for the thesis by explaining the context or the problem being addressed? Does it introduce a new argument in support of the thesis? Does it further explain or support an argument that has already been introduced? Or does it do something else?

- Second, use this analysis to construct an outline that illustrates the argument’s structure. (If the text is lengthy, this may be a good group activity: divide the text into sections, and give each section to a different individual or small group.)
This kind of rhetorical analysis can be tricky, so here are more detailed, step-by-step instructions for creating “What It Says/What It Does” notes.

##### Step 1 
Draw a line down the middle of a page in your notebook, creating two columns. Or set up two columns in a word processing document. (See the Guidelines box on p. 000 for instructions on how to do this.) At the top of the left column, write “What It Says,” and at the top of the right column, write “What It Does.” For each paragraph in the essay, write one or two sentences in the left column that summarize what the paragraph says, and one or two in the right column that state the function of this paragraph within the argument. Figuring out the function of each paragraph can be tricky, but it is the key to any analysis of rhetorical structure. Avoid summary here, and avoid repeating what you’ve already written in the left column. Instead, work out how the paragraph contributes to the writer’s argument, how it moves the argument forward. If the paragraph were absent, what would the argument be missing? What kind of “move” is the writer making? What is the writer doing that serves the larger purpose of the essay?

It’s okay if these “What It Does” notes are a little messy—you’ll be revising anyway. If a paragraph’s function is not immediately clear, leave the right column blank and come back to the paragraph later. But complete the right-hand column before moving on to Step 2. 

Although this work may take some time and some trial and error, you’ll learn a great deal from it about how experienced writers develop an effective argument. In the following example based on Jane McGonigal’s “Be a Gamer, Save the World,” the entries on the left briefly summarize the key points in the first six paragraphs, while the entries on the right explain what these paragraphs do for the argument. You may want to complete the analysis for paragraphs 7–16 on your own.

#### WHAT IT SAYS
¶1. Many think of video games (VGs) as a “retreat from reality” & a waste of time, but they fill needs that the real world doesn’t and may be a “resource” for solving real problems.
¶2. A great many people play VGs! A lot. Time spent on WoW alone 5 5.63 million years!
¶3. Gamers “often feel that the real world is missing something.”
¶4. Reality isn’t as engaging, thrilling, or motivating as gaming worlds and isn’t “engineered . . . to make us happy.”
¶5. Gamers have advantages: VGs provide 4 ingredients of happy & meaningful life. Support: her own research.
¶6. Games offer “intrinsic rewards,” and research shows that these “provide the foundation for optimal human experience.”

#### WHAT IT DOES
Introduces thesis. Contrasts this view with conventional opinion. Answers the question, “Are video games a waste of time?”
Establishes the importance of her argument by giving data about how much time people spend playing VGs.
Flips the conventional view that the virtual world of VGs is the one that’s lacking.
Presents a major claim to support the main argument.
Introduces research that supports her views—gives her credibility (U Cal Berkeley, Institute for the Future).
Implies that something that seems a limitation of VGs is actually a strength (the rewards are all inside the game experience itself).

##### Step 2
Now construct an outline of the argument’s structure, based on the right-hand column of your “What It Says/What It Does” notes. Begin by identifying how paragraphs with a similar function can be grouped together. For example, several paragraphs might all be telling one story, or explaining one example, and these might provide support for a claim; this claim might in turn support one aspect of the author’s main thesis.
Once you have completed your “What It Says/What It Does” double-entry notes, you can move on to create an outline of the rhetorical structure, which might look something like this:

#### Partial Analytical Outline of “Be a Gamer, Save the World”
Paragraphs 1–4 introduce the main argument.
¶1. Establishes her position that video games fulfill genuine needs and help players learn to solve real-world problems, in contrast to conventional opinion that video games offer only a “passive retreat from reality.”
¶2. Establishes the importance of the issue by providing data about the popularity of gaming. Shifts the terms of debate by substituting the phrase “alternate reality” for the more common “virtual reality.”
¶3. Claims that many gamers feel that it’s the real world that’s missing something. Turns the tables on the conventional view.
¶4. Elaborates by claiming that the real world does not offer the same pleasures, challenges and opportunities for social bonding as the gaming world. Supports this claim by reasoning that the real world isn’t “engineered” to maximize our potential as the gaming world is. This is a major claim in support of her thesis.
Paragraphs 5–10 detail the psychological benefits of gaming for real-world activities.
¶5. Claims that gamers have an advantage over non-gamers and are using their skills to do good. Supports this by citing her own research that shows video games supply four ingredients of a happy life.
¶6. Further claims that these benefits are “intrinsic rewards,” and cites studies that show that such rewards form the basis of “optimal human experience.”

### Rhetorical Analysis
Complete the “What It Says/What It Does” notebook for paragraphs 7–16, and then complete the outline, devoting a line or two to each paragraph.
(Note the shift in direction that the argument takes in paragraph 11.) The real point is that even a brief argument like this contains a logical structure of claims and support. Analyzing the structure of the argument, whether formally as above,
in the margins of the text, or even mentally, reveals the argument’s structure and helps us see its strengths and weaknesses. (For example, to support her claim
in paragraph 10 that the sense of awe produced by an epic video game makes gamers act more selflessly, McGonigal cites “researchers on positive emotion.” But did they study awe and wonder in virtual worlds or in real worlds? Then again, does it make any difference?)

### Constructing a Radial Map of the Text
A radial map is a diagram of a text, using boxes, circles, and lines to arrange elements on a single page so that the text’s structure becomes visible at a glance. Sub-headings radiate out from the main theme at the center or down from the top. (See Figure 3.1 for an example.) Such a map is a useful tool to have on hand as you begin writing about a text, but its benefits lie just as much in the process of working out how to put all the pieces together. The construction of a radial map requires that you collect all the important elements of an argument or exploration, consider how these elements relate to one another, and arrange them all under headings that connect to the central theme so that the entire essay can be visualized at once. This process entails a good deal of analysis and results in a strong grasp of the text’s structure. Radial maps are especially useful when working with a text that is full of detail; they are perhaps most helpful for readers who are visually inclined.
If you have access to a drawing program or mind-mapping application on your computer, you can block out themes and main points first and then move them around, experimenting with different arrangements.
Whether working on a computer or on paper, you’ll begin by jotting down main headings and themes on a blank sheet of paper, arranging them more or less randomly at first. Once you begin to see patterns and relationships among the headings, you can start creating a map on a fresh document or sheet. Note that the central theme may shift as you read: for example, the central theme of Nicholas Carr’s essay “Is Google Making Us Stupid?” might seem at first to be “Google” (based on the title). But after reading the entire essay carefully, a term such as “concentration” or “attention” might seem to be more truly at the center.

Figure 3.1 Radial Map of Nicholas Carr’s “Is Google Making Us Stupid?”


Write down the theme of the essay in a box at the center or top of the page, and then begin arranging main headings around or below this box. Elaborate the map by arranging subheadings and subtopics in relation to each of the main headings. You will see patterns emerge that you might not have noticed otherwise. You will almost certainly find that you need to revise as you proceed: rearranging and even starting over always seems to be necessary as the map becomes more complicated and more complete — and as the structure of the argument becomes more clear.

## Evaluating the Argument
### Reading with and against the Grain
The note-taking methods we have discussed so far in this chapter have focused on understanding a text more deeply through analysis and exegesis. But you will sometimes need to go further and evaluate the argument as well. Too often, readers pass judgment on a text without really taking the time to consider it carefully. So hold off evaluating a text until after you’ve spent sufficient time with it to understand it fully.
Your first reading of a text (and perhaps your second and third readings, if the text is a difficult one) should focus on what the author is saying: you look at the question from the author’s point of view, and in so doing, you “try on” his or her ideas.The “principle of charity,” discussed in Chapter 2, states an essential precept for this kind of thinking: we need to be a “friend” to an argument and give it a fair chance before we can justifiably be its critic. When we read in this way, attempting to look at the world through the writer’s eyes, we are reading “with the grain” of the essay: we are turned in the direction that the essay points. But there is also value in reading “against the grain” and bringing a more skeptical mind to bear on the text. (When working with wood, it is easiest to cut with the grain, in the direction of the tree’s growth; cutting against the grain is harder due to the wood’s resistance.) The point is not to demolish the argument—and certainly not to dismiss it unfairly, forgetting everything we learned from reading with the grain — but to test the argument, to find out its weaknesses, and to imagine alternatives to it.

This exercise might produce any number of outcomes. You might find fatal flaws in the argument and decide that an opposing argument, or counterargument, has greater merit. You might discover that, although other points of view and other arguments are possible, the author’s argument is a very strong one, and you are more convinced by it than ever. Often, though, you’ll find some weaknesses and some strengths, and you’ll have to weigh the former against the latter to see where you stand. This is a necessary part of critical reading and formulating a response.

### Believing and Doubting
The “believing and doubting game” is a strategy developed by the scholar and teacher Peter Elbow. The word “game” is used because this strategy requires you to play roles — to step away from what you really do believe for a moment and to pretend you are someone different. Once you’ve become well-acquainted with an argument, write out all the reasons that someone might have for believing it, and then see if you can imagine other arguments for believing it, in addition to those the writer has given. In other words, be the writer’s strongest advocate and ally. Give this the time it needs: twenty to thirty minutes at least.

Now play the “doubting” game. Put yourself in the shoes of a person who is deeply skeptical of the writer’s views. First, you’ll need to work out what the opposing view—the counterargument—would look like. Write it out as a thesis statement. Then imagine the details of the counterargument. Ask yourself, “What possible reasons could such a person have for taking a contrary position?” Make a list of as many reasons as you can think of, including weak ones: writing out weak reasons may help you think of other, stronger reasons. (And sometimes, on reflection, weak reasons turn out to be not so weak after all!) Then select the most persuasive of the arguments you’ve listed and write them out as an argument.

An important aspect of the doubting game, indeed of any critical reading, is to identify weaknesses, if any, in the writer’s rhetoric. Some kinds of argument are inherently flawed because they involve mistakes of reasoning:

>All Americans love their country. Paul McCartney loves his country. Therefore, Paul McCartney is an American.

Of course, the error in this example lies in the fact that while it might be true that “all Americans love their country,” it is not true that only Americans love their country. Paul McCartney is English, so it’s quite possible for him to love his country and not be an American. The mistake here is obvious, once you give it a moment’s thought, but this kind of logical error, or fallacy, can be subtle and easy to miss in the context of a larger argument. Other kinds of fallacies are not logical errors but ethically questionable strategies: for example, an argument might appeal to the baser instincts of the reader — the tendency to go with the crowd, perhaps, rather than examine an argument on its merits, however unpopular.

### Representing Another’s Ideas Fairly and Accurately
A final observation concerns both reading attentively and reading critically. Any writer who works with another writer’s ideas may be tempted to shape those ideas to suit his or her own purposes, and thereby risks misrepresenting or distort them. To do so deliberately would be a serious breach of ethics. But we should also bear in mind that a writer can misrepresent another’s ideas through mere carelessness or neglect, without intending to be dishonest. For example, you might need to summarize a writer’s argument to give support to an argument of your own. But in doing so, you might accidentally omit certain details and qualifications that make a considerable difference to the writer’s point. The result may be that you not only misrepresent the other writer’s point but also create an argument of your own that cannot stand up to scrutiny. There’s a difference between using another person’s ideas and abusing those ideas — and sometimes the difference is subtle.

Imagine, for example, a student writing a sociology paper about the ways the Internet is changing society and how people relate to one another. Suppose the student wants to argue that behaviors and relationships are now being shaped by large companies such as Facebook, Apple, and Google in ways that were unimaginable thirty years ago. Having read Nicholas Carr’s “Is Google Making Us Stupid?,” he might want to enlist Carr in support of his argument, and he writes something like this: “Carr argues that Google uses Frederick Winslow Taylor’s principles of scientific management to turn Internet users into cogs in a machine or system that works entirely for its own benefit.” But Carr doesn’t go quite this far, and the difference, though subtle, is important. Carr doesn’t say that Google uses Taylor’s principles; he only suggests that the way it functions is similar to the way Taylor’s system functions. Nor does he quite say that Google turns people into cogs in a system that benefits only Google itself; he does suggest, though, that Google, as well as other companies that dominate the way we use the Internet, seems to be pushing in that   direction, and that Google’s aims reveal a tendency to want to subordinate individual human beings to a vast artificial intelligence. But directions and tendencies aren’t quite the same thing as an actual deed. As Carr goes on to say a few paragraphs later, he is worried—but perhaps needlessly. A careful and responsible summary of Carr’s argument would reflect this distinction.

### Paraphrasing a Passage
Select a brief passage (10–15 lines) from one of the essays that have been reprinted in Part 5 of this book. Draft a paraphrase of the passage by expressing the writer’s ideas in your own words. Now reread the original passage a couple of times (you might also need to reread the paragraphs that precede and follow it, in order to get a clearer sense of the context). Revise your paraphrase so that it represents the writer’s thought more accurately, but take care not to use the writer’s own words. If you must use one or two phrases from the original, put them in quotation marks to avoid plagiarizing.

The temptation to misrepresent or oversimplify (even unconsciously) is sometimes great because academic writers (whether freshmen or professionals) face deadlines and high expectations. We are often looking for something when we read, perhaps something specific or perhaps just anything we can use, and it’s easy to be a little too eager to find it — and to pretend we’ve found it even if it’s not quite there. We must frequently paraphrase and summarize other writers’ ideas, and we must do so in such a way that we show the relevance and meaning of those ideas to our own argument. It’s much more difficult to represent the ideas of others accurately than it is to oversimplify or reconstruct or slant or slightly exaggerate those ideas. We shall look further at particular strategies for paraphrasing and summarizing in Chapter 9.

### Writing a Letter to the Author
Another way to work out your response to a reading is to write a letter to the author. This technique helps you focus your thoughts, formulate your questions and ideas, and “speak back” to the text. For many writers, the personal letter is a familiar mode of writing, one that allows them to write honestly and openly, whereas note-taking can lead them to write in more formal, detached, and inhibited ways. Writing a letter to the author provides an “enabling fiction”: imagining a real person as the audience of your remarks is an effective way to enter into a conversation with a text and to sidestep anxieties about formal, graded academic writing that can restrain your creativity.

## Talking Out Your Ideas
### Use Class Discussion
In class, your dialectical notebook can do double duty. On one hand, it contains questions and observations that you can put to your classmates, and you can develop your notes on the basis of their comments. On the other hand, discussion can spark ideas to record in your notebook and work out more fully later on. In many college courses, discussion plays a crucial role. Its purpose is to give students the opportunity to think ideas through and to arrive at their own understanding of a text, rather than simply relying on the professor’s interpretation and taking it at face value. Students are expected to come to class with comments and questions prepared and to express their views clearly and reasonably for the class to consider. Instructors hope you will work out your own views and come to your own insights; they do not want to see their own views echoed back in a dozen or more identical papers. Class discussion affords an opportunity to figure out where you stand and how your views compare to others so that you can make a strong and interesting argument in your writing. A dialectical notebook can be an essential tool in making such discussions work for you.

### Discuss with a Friend, Classmate, Tutor, or Professor
If you read actively, and especially if you use some of the strategies you have learned in Part 1, you will soon reach a point where you have some ideas about the texts you are reading, but these ideas may be vague or confused at first. It might help to get some feedback at this point. Just listening to yourself talk out your ideas can help to clarify them and give you a sense of their strengths and weaknesses. But feedback from a colleague, a friend, or an instructor can be just as helpful. There’s nothing wrong with seeking feedback of this sort, and it doesn’t make your ideas any less your own.
