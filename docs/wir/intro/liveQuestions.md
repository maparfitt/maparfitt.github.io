## “Live the Questions”
In *Letters to a Young Poet* (1903), the celebrated Austrian poet Rainer Maria Rilke writes to an unnamed younger poet, offering guidance and advice as the youth embarks on a lifelong journey that will demand enormous dedication and hard work. Rilke tells him that he will need patience, that he should not expect to find quick, easy solutions for his doubts and questions. To obtain answers, he will need to “live the questions.”

>I would like to beg you, dear Sir, as well as I can, to have patience with everything unresolved in your heart and to try to love the questions themselves as if they were locked rooms or books written in a very foreign language. Don’t search for the answers, which could not be given to you now, because you would not be able to live them. And the point is, to live everything. Live the questions now. Perhaps then, someday far in the future, you will gradually, without even noticing it, live your way into the answer.[^5]

The situation of the young poet might seem very different from that of the average college student. In many respects, it is: student writers are under pressure to meet deadlines, to study for exams, to fulfill the exacting requirements of an instructor’s assignments, to earn good grades — and to balance all this with a satisfactory personal life. How different from the poet who can afford the time to “gradually, without even noticing it, live [his or her] way into the answer”!

But looked at from another point of view, Rilke’s advice may be pertinent after all. In the end, all those readings, lectures, exams, and assignments must add up to something; they cannot be perfectly disconnected from one another, each an end in itself. In fact, any thoughtful student notices threads that run from one assignment to another, one course to another; together, these threads compose an education. And let’s not forget that the point of college studies is to be found not merely in a grade or diploma but in the way it changes us, making us more informed, understanding, and wise.

At the center of a liberal education are fundamental questions: Who am I? What is the good life? What kind of world do I live in? How did we get here?

In the thick of reading and writing to complete an assignment, we need to remind ourselves of these questions from time to time. And we need to remember to reflect on the meaning of readings and lectures for our actual lives, our actual selves. To “live the questions” means taking the questions into our lives and making them truly our own—pondering them at any time of day, not only when we’re studying but also when we’re exercising or commuting or relaxing or talking with friends. It means taking the work seriously and letting it enter the parts of our lives that are not strictly given over to work.

We cannot really respond to a writer unless we are willing to “live the questions,” to make connections between what a writer says and all the other things we know or think or wonder about. Responding to a reading means allowing our questions to surface and be taken seriously. It means developing a connection between schoolwork and the thinking that you do outside of school. Over the long term, this habit will help you make the most of your education. But in the short term, it will also help you write more interesting and satisfying essays.
