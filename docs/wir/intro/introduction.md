## Writing in Response to Reading

>"In many ways writing is the act of saying _I,_ of imposing oneself upon other people, of saying _listen to me, see it my way, change your mind."_ -- Joan Didion

>Hey sis: What’s up? College is still great. Classes still pretty interesting. And I’m pressing my nose to the grindstone as Dad would say. The only downer is English — which is weird because in high school that was always a personal best. Got As and Bs without even trying. But my prof gave me a C on my first paper, even though I worked really hard on it, and Julio (remember my roommate Julio, smart kid with green hair?) said it was an A, guaranteed.

>Honestly, I can’t figure out the problem. The course is Writing about Literature — which is something I’ve done before. Plenty. And I have to give Prof. Hughes credit: he gives a good lecture. I almost always stay awake. I used the five-paragraph structure that Mrs. Kelly taught back in sophomore year, so I know it was organized. I stayed away from saying anything too controversial because I didn’t want to be wrong; just made three really strong points.

>I used the thesaurus and found some great words to use, like “stentorian” and “pusillanimous.” Impressive, no? I also included a classy quotation about narrative by someone named Robert Coover. I opened the essay with it, along with a dictionary definition of “narrative.”

>So far, my prof hasn’t explained the C. I did make some grammar mistakes. Maybe I’ll go see him tomorrow. Anyway, I won’t let this thing eat away at me! I’m sure I’ll do better on the next paper, which is due at midterms.

This book is for Sam. He’ll soon learn that some of his notions about what Professor Hughes hoped to find in his essay were misplaced, and those misconceptions are the chief reason he earned a C — not because he was poorly prepared in high school or because he lacks brains or writing talent, but because his expectations for the assignment were different from his professor’s. And eventually he’ll begin to understand what Professor Hughes and his other instructors do hope to find in his papers, and he may even begin to understand why they want these things. Assuming that Sam does speak to Professor Hughes and that Professor Hughes explains to him where he went wrong and how he can do better next time, the C grade might prove to be a blessing. Some students spend months, even years, trying to figure out through trial and error what professors want in a paper. One of the aims of this book is to explain what professors want, and why. The other is to provide strategies and exercises to help you not just meet expectations but surpass them — and get the most you can out of the experience.

So this book is also for students who, unlike Sam, might do fairly well on their papers right from the start but would find the process of writing college essays more rewarding, enjoyable, and worthwhile if they were armed with certain concepts and strategies. After all, the point of writing in college is not ultimately to get good grades but to learn, and essay assignments afford an exceptional opportunity to develop ideas of your own and share them with your instructor and perhaps your classmates. Over the long run, many students find that this kind of learning is the most meaningful and exciting they do. One premise of this book is that it should be — and certainly can be.

When college professors read student essays, their expectations are often quite different from those of high school teachers. This difference, which professors sometimes take for granted and fail to explain, can be one of the great obstacles that students face when they begin writing at the college level. The mere fact that a difference exists may become clear early in the freshman year, as it did for Sam, but what the difference is and why it exists can remain a mystery for years. Some students complete their entire undergraduate program without being quite sure what professors are looking for in their writing or how to go about actually producing it. For them, writing can feel like a game of chance, with grades awarded randomly and unpredictably, or as if there’s a secret to it that no one is willing to share. Some students do seem to catch on at some point and do consistently well — though even they may have trouble saying exactly what it is they’ve grasped and how it relates to their educational goals.

It would be nice if there were a simple one-sentence answer to the question “What do professors want from student writing?” There isn’t. But while there may be no foolproof recipe for success, certain concepts and strategies can help anyone be more successful in pursuit not only of grades but also of the more lasting rewards that grades are meant to stand for: meaningful learning, the satis- faction of expressing ideas effectively, a proud sense of accomplishment and craftsmanship. These concepts and strategies can be learned without great difficulty. Nevertheless, “a smooth sea never made a skilled mariner,” as the saying goes. Most of the time, good writing takes hard work, and there’s no getting around it. But while misdirected effort leads to frustration and disappointment, even very hard work can be deeply satisfying when the rewards, both shortand long-term, repay the cost.

We mentioned concepts and strategies that can help you be a successful college writer. The chief aim of this introductory chapter is to clarify concepts[^1] — the ideas that underlie the professors’ expectations for college writing. Most of the rest of the book is devoted to strategies — tools and techniques to help you meet these expectations. Three of the ten chapters in this book discuss reading and note-taking. This might seem odd in a book about writing, but, for reasons that we will explain shortly, reading and note-taking — of a particularly careful and thoughtful kind — play so essential a role in the process of college writing that it makes sense to devote a good deal of time and attention to them.

## Exploring the Culture of Education

Option 1. An “ethnography” is a description of a culture or subculture, with particular emphasis on the rules or norms that define the culture. In two or three pages, describe the culture, social and academic, of your high school. Then, in one or two additional pages, describe as best you can the social and academic culture of college, based on your experience so far. Finally, write two or three paragraphs to compare the two cultures and draw conclusions: How are they similar? How are they different? And how did your expectations of the culture of college compare to your actual experience so far?

Option 2. Visit your college or university Web site and review some of the pages that describe its academic programs. What do these descriptions reveal about the culture of higher education in general and of your college in particular? What goals and expectations does your college have for its students? How might a student’s work as a writer contribute to meeting these goals and expectations? In a two- to three-page essay, write up your conclusions.
