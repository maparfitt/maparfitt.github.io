# How to use this site

The site consists of three components:
- The *Writing in Response* ebook
- The Handbook (a reference for grammar and style)
- Resources (for instructors and students)

You can access each of these components from the navigation bar at the top of the screen. You can also choose individual chapters of the ebook from the "Writing in Response" menu.

The Resources component requires registration and log in, but it's completely free, like the rest of the site. It gives instructors access to instructional resources, and gives students access to quizzes and exercises.
