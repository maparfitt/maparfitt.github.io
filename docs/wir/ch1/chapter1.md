## Reading with a Purpose
 
> "Read not to contradict and confute, or to believe and take for granted . . . but to weigh and consider." Francis Bacon

In the academic world, reading is part of the writing process. To respond to a text in a meaningful way, a writer must first listen carefully to what the text is saying. In the case of academic writing, this usually means tracing the main argument — which is something more than just the general topic or main themes — and grasping it firmly enough to be able to assess its strengths and weaknesses. Sometimes this presents few difficulties and the argument is clear enough after just one reading, but frequently understanding the main argument requires concentration, effort, and several passes through the text. And even when a text is fairly straightforward, reading it at least twice usually pays dividends if you’re planning to write about it.

Academic texts, including the kind that college professors assign to first-year students, are often particularly demanding, so attentive and thoughtful reading is an essential part of college writing. Good academic essays — not just student essays but nearly all academic essays — result from a thinking process that begins in a dialogue with texts, a give-and-take involving listening and responding. Such dialogues require active reading and rereading, drawing on just about all of your mental faculties as you question, analyze, reason, weigh, make inferences, and develop ideas of your own. This isn’t the kind of reading you do hastily at the start of the writing process and then put behind you. The dialogue continues throughout the writing process: as experienced writers know, reading or rereading is not only the best way to get started but also the best way to get moving again when you’re stuck.

Any text you plan to write about should be read more than once, and usually several times. This means that you can hold off making judgments or worrying too much about your own response at first and just concentrate on making good sense of the author’s argument. You can develop well-thought-out ideas later: the first thing is to get the most clear and full understanding possible of what the text has to say. Often, this task alone is challenging. The problem many readers have with long or difficult academic texts is not that they fail to understand anything about the texts but that they fail to gather up all the pieces of the jigsaw puzzle, fit them together, and clearly see the big picture, the main point. Readers who miss that main point can only produce a response that is to some degree irrelevant and pointless, however inventive and well argued it may be.

Unfortunately, careful reading is an aspect of the writing process that students do frequently neglect. Under pressure to meet a deadline, they are naturally tempted to cut corners, and rereading may seem a time-consuming task that can be hurried a bit. But doing so can thwart all your efforts from the starting gate. In the Introduction, we noted that one cause of disappointing essays is thin, simplistic ideas that are weakly supported by evidence. A clear understanding and full appreciation of another writer’s ideas — even if you ultimately disagree with them — is the first step toward developing rich, interesting, strongly supported ideas of your own, whether you are writing a research paper or working on an analytical essay involving just one or two assigned readings.

This chapter concerns some fundamentals of reading with a purpose — that is, reading with the ultimate goal of coming up with something interesting and valid to say. Chapter 2 offers basic strategies for active reading, and Chapter 3 offers several additional strategies for working closely with arguments, strategies that you can use where appropriate but probably will not use routinely.

First, to better understand this concept of “active reading,” let’s consider what any sort of reading really involves.

Physically, a text is made up of ink marks on a page or dots on a screen: letters, punctuation marks, numerals, spaces. As children, we learn to decipher the code and recognize words that the marks represent. But reading means much more than this: it involves perceiving how a series of isolated letters and words make sense as meaningful phrases and sentences, and tracing a sequence of meanings as they accumulate across a whole page, a chapter, a book. It’s what you’re doing right now: continually putting together the sentence you are now reading with everything you’ve read so far in order to make sense of the whole, developing and revising your sense of the whole as you go.

So it is not only the writer’s job to “make sense” but also the reader’s. When we’re reading something that’s easy or familiar, we are barely aware of this need to put together the meaning of the text — in a sense, to “compose” it. But when we’re faced with difficult or unfamiliar writing, even if written clearly, making sense of the text is a job that calls for great powers of concentration and tenacity.

The ancient Greek philosopher Socrates famously distrusted the written word because he believed it weakened the memory and because the absence of the writer allowed the text to be misunderstood. Indeed, the capacity of most people to remember exactly what they’ve heard does appear to be much weaker today than it was in Socrates’ time, and certainly texts are often misinterpreted. But the modern world relies utterly on writing—from the constitutions that undergird our legal systems to the Twitter feeds that tell us the latest news — so we must deal with the fact that the absence of the writer defines the task that both readers and writers face: both must “make sense” without the benefit of a present speaker who can clarify, correct, or revise. Writing is communication at a distance — but unlike talking on the telephone or through a microphone, it normally takes place across time as well as space. This spatial and temporal distance complicates communication through the written word but also accounts for its tremendous power. “Thanks to writing, man and only man has a world and not just a situation,” wrote the French philosopher Paul Ricoeur.[^1] Writing makes it possible to know how women lived in China a thousand years ago, who won yesterday’s hockey game in Philadelphia, how to roast a Thanksgiving turkey, how many moons circle Jupiter, and, of course, what Socrates had to say about writing. (If Socrates’ student Plato had not written down his teacher’s ideas, we would probably know little about them today.) By reading, we come to know the world and to have a world.
 
What’s the point of all this? It reminds us that reading is never simply the passive act of absorbing information. Making sense of a text does not mean simply figuring out what the author meant; for a text to make real sense, it has to make sense to you: you have to recognize the words and phrases, and the text’s meanings have to “fit” somehow with other things you know, even if the subject is all quite new to you. Usually we do not know the author personally, but we recognize the world that he or she describes, at least partially. The late English novelist Angela Carter observed, “Reading a book is like rewriting it for yourself. You bring to a novel, anything you read, all your experience of the world. You bring your history and you read it in your own terms.”[^2] The practical consequence is that reading well means understanding that the reader is an active player in the game of making meaning. Readers can never know exactly what the author intended; all they have to go by are the marks on the page. Your reading of a text will differ a little from mine, but this doesn’t mean that all interpretations are equally valid. A reader cannot simply invent a text’s meaning and make it mean anything at all. Readers have a dual responsibility: they must strive to work out the author’s meaning, and at the same time they must work out its meaning for themselves. This is the basis of the dialogue that generates ideas for writing.

### Reading Closely
Read Geoff Dyer’s short essay “Blues for Vincent” (p. 000) at least twice. Note that it is divided into four sections that are separated from each other by breaks in the text. What connections and echoes do you see — themes or phrases or feelings that suggest some relation between the sections? What would you identify as the main point or idea that ties the four sections together? How do you interpret the last sentence of the essay?

Compare your reading of the essay with that of other students in your class. Do they differ? How and why? Write one or two pages discussing your answer to these questions.

## Academic Reading: Reading with a Purpose
We read with many different purposes—to be informed, edified, entertained, stirred, provoked, persuaded. Much of our reading rewards us on several levels at the same time. In college, of course, the principal purpose for reading is to learn, and so the way you read should differ from the way you would read a book for entertainment. As you have probably already discovered, reading to learn often requires more effort than reading for pleasure, more focused concentration, and more active involvement. After all, you did not choose these texts for yourself, the subject matter tends to be unfamiliar, and you can’t just skim past difficult or tedious passages. Reading in order to complete a writing assignment is even more demanding: not only must you fully grasp the text’s meaning, but you must also work out what you have to say about it and perhaps also how it fits into a larger project.

Close reading (reading slowly, with careful attention to the text) is an essential skill for nearly all college students and professors. Good academic writing presents fresh and interesting ideas that are based on solid research and sound reasoning. While research can take many forms (chemists conduct experiments in laboratories, anthropologists observe human culture in locations far and near, archaeologists dig through the remains of lost civilizations, historians study documents in archives, and so on), nearly every kind of research involves reading at some point — and not just casual reading but a careful analysis of arguments made by others concerning the problem under investigation. To produce new and worthwhile ideas, researchers must become familiar with the work that has already been done on the problem; otherwise, they might merely duplicate existing work and pointlessly retrace someone else’s steps. Thus, even field and lab researchers must do lots of reading before they get started. Moreover, they need expertise to understand the meaning and importance of whatever they might find in the course of research, and they can develop this expertise only by reading extensively. So the ability to say something fresh and interesting depends to a great extent on careful reading — even in fields that rely heavily on experiment and observation. Reading is the starting point: reading the work of others gives researchers the questions and insights that make it possible to say something new and useful.
Close reading is important beyond the walls of the university too. Nonacademic research projects — such as the kind that journalists do to write magazine or newspaper articles, that lawyers do to build a case, that architects and engineers do to create new structures — also require this kind of responsive and creative reading. Both academic and nonacademic researchers must do more than simply summarize the work of others: their research must be informed by what they read, but it must produce something new as well.

So it’s no accident that when reading student essays, professors usually look for signs that students have read the assigned texts attentively and fully grasped the arguments. If you fail to show that you’ve read the text carefully, your argument will not be based on the kind of evidence your instructor probably expects.

Reading with a purpose, then, means reading with the aim of responding, rather than reading simply to take in a writer’s ideas. Like professional researchers, student writers must become familiar with the work of others and then bring something fresh to the conversation. Reading with a purpose is reading as a means to an end, rather than as an end in itself, and it bridges reading and writing — a kind of reading that is itself almost a kind of writing, certainly the first step in the process of academic writing. So academic reading is always a special kind of reading, different from reading a novel for pleasure or reading the newspaper casually over breakfast or surfing randomly across Web pages. Whether you are writing an ambitious research paper or simply a brief response to a single text, reading with a purpose means reading with questions always in mind: “How does this argument work? How strongly supported are the author’s claims? What does this argument mean to me? How would I respond? What questions does it raise? What further problems does it imply?” This kind of reading launches a kind of dialogue with the text, as you struggle to figure out where you stand in relation to the writer’s argument, or to work out how you might respond to it.

But as we suggested above, the first step is to make sense of that argument fully and precisely. The crucial difference between reading with a purpose well and reading with a purpose poorly is chiefly a matter of recognizing and respecting the author’s purpose. In the case of academic writing, this usually means recognizing and respecting the author’s argument and the context or situation in which it was made.

### Context
Earlier we noted that readers have a dual responsibility: they must try to work out the author’s meaning and, at the same time, work out what the text means for them as individuals. An important aspect of working out the author’s meaning involves taking into account the historical or cultural situation in which the author was writing — that is, the context. The beliefs and values of one culture can be quite different from another’s; this may be true even of assumptions so deeply held that individuals in that culture may be unaware of them. And beliefs, values, and assumptions change through time as well, so that a way of seeing and understanding the world in one century can seem quite foreign to readers in a later century. Arthur Miller’s 1953 play The Crucible shows how fervently many citizens in seventeenth-century New England feared witchcraft. Indirectly, Miller was condemning the “witch hunts” in his own time (the 1950s) for Communist sympathizers; the mentalities of both periods might seem unintelligible to members of an audience today— unless they strive to see the world through others’ eyes and to understand the real fear that gripped people in both those periods as a result of their beliefs. A Japanese writer of two centuries ago might bring to the subject of class relations very different assumptions than those of many readers today. A contemporary Brazilian writer might see issues involved in environmental policy quite differently from the way many Americans see them. Ideally, readers should try to learn as much as they can about the thinking of the writer’s time period and culture in order to avoid misapprehensions. When this is impractical, readers should at least make allowances for historical and cultural differences, recognizing that what’s strange or puzzling about a text may reflect a different way of thinking and opening their imaginations to a different way of seeing the world. Often, these differences have much to teach us; they help us recognize our own assumptions and put them in perspective. And readers cannot adequately assess an argument without recognizing the cultural or historical differences that might explain the author’s point of view.
Books usually contain clues about the time and place in which they were written. Here is some guidance on where to look.

- The copyright page at the front of the book usually includes the date and place of earliest publication.
- A preface or introductory chapter may explain the author’s purpose or offer useful information about the circumstances in which the text was written.
- When reprinted in anthologies or textbooks, essays or chapters often include short introductions or “headnotes” that provide background information and a sense of historical and cultural context. The headnotes may also tell you something about the author’s career and work. See page 000 for an example.

This kind of information is helpful when available, but readers can gather important clues about context from another source: the body of the text itself. Typically, a writer will reveal a good deal about the context of his or her argument in the first paragraph or two, describing (though sometimes very briefly) an existing controversy or question that he or she intends to address. For example, in “Drug War Nightmare: How We Created a Massive Racial Caste System in America” (p. 000), legal scholar Michelle Alexander outlines the context of her argument in the first two paragraphs, just before she announces her main purpose and thesis, that “racial caste is alive and well in America.”
Ever since Barack Obama lifted his right hand and took his oath of office, pledging to serve the United States as its 44th president, ordinary people and their leaders around the globe have been celebrating our nation’s “triumph over race.” Obama’s election has been touted as the final nail in the coffin of Jim Crow, the bookend placed on the history of racial caste in America.

Obama’s mere presence in the Oval Office is offered as proof that “the land of the free” has finally made good on its promise of equality. There’s an implicit yet undeniable message embedded in his appearance on the world stage: this is what freedom looks like; this is what democracy can do for you. If you are poor, marginalized, or relegated to an inferior caste, there is hope for you. Trust us. Trust our rules, laws, customs, and wars. You, too, can get to the promised land.

Perhaps greater lies have been told in the past century, but they can be counted on one hand. Racial caste is alive and well in America.

Here Alexander positions her argument as a contribution to a long-standing conversation about race in America, and more exactly about the fate of African Americans since the Civil Rights Act of 1964 put an end to the Jim Crow laws that had enforced segregation. At the same time, she positions her argument in relation to the historical context represented by the election of Barack Obama to the presidency in 2008, an event that for many symbolized the end — or at least the beginning of the end — of African Americans’ struggle for equality in the post–Jim Crow era. Most American readers today will be familiar with this social and historical context, so the significance of Alexander’s argument is not hard for them to see. But in the case of more specialized academic writing, the first two or three paragraphs of an article may contain clues about a debate or a question that can help us understand the importance of the author’s argument.
Scholarly essays invariably make an argument that relates to a problem — often a controversial, unresolved, or problematic aspect of a larger project (in the case of Alexander’s article, the problem is the persistent social and economic inequality of African Americans). The writer usually aims to contribute something to a conversation that is already in progress. (Occasionally, a writer attempts to launch a completely new conversation, but even then, the writer will often refer to a recognized problem or context that helps explain why this new conversation is needed.) Recognizing this context — the problem that warrants the argument — helps us understand the author’s purpose, but we may have to read carefully to find it, and we may need to make a few inferences or even do some quick research to understand it fully when we do.
        
### Guidelines: Analyzing Rhetorical Context
Whenever you read a piece of academic writing, look in the first two or three paragraphs for answers to the following questions. (Occasionally the answers may appear later in the essay.)
- Whom is the writer primarily addressing? Who is the expected audience?
- When was the text written? Where? What do you know about the political and social realities of that time and place?
- How will the argument contribute to an existing conversation? What is that conversation about? Why does this conversation matter?
- What is the author’s purpose?

## Your Own Contexts
When assigned as a reading in a college course, an article like Alexander’s has another context — the goals of the course—and while this context does not normally conflict with the author’s purpose, it is not quite identical with it either. If you were reading Alexander’s article in a sociology course, it might be paired with one or two other readings that present very different perspectives on the question of race in America. The instructor might expect you to see it as one position statement in a larger debate. In a writing course, the purpose for reading it might be quite different: to illustrate certain features of critical thinking, perhaps, or to show how an academic argument can be structured. You thus need to recognize not only the author’s purpose but also the instructor’s purpose in assigning it.

Finally, working out a text’s meaning involves a third context: the reader’s. Not only do writers produce texts in a particular historical and cultural situation, but readers read them in some situation that influences the way the text gets used and even understood. If you read Charles Dickens’s Oliver Twist (1838) on your own over a vacation, you would likely read it differently than if you were to read it for a nineteenth-century British literature course. There, you might be asked to compare it to other novels by Dickens and to novels by other authors; you might be encouraged to think about its relation to British social problems and political struggles of the nineteenth century; you might read critical essays on the novel by scholars who read it from a Marxist perspective, or a feminist perspective, or a biographical perspective, and these articles might influence your own thinking about the novel. And of course, you would probably be concerned with the exam or paper that you’d have to write. But if you read Oliver Twist on your own, over summer vacation, you might be more likely simply to enjoy the plot and the characters and to think about the novel in relation to your own life. This is not a bad thing — indeed, it is essential — but the course might lead you to think about the book differently. For example, you might pay closer attention to the possible interpretations of other readers and find yourself justifying your own reading in preparation for any questions that might be raised about it. Reading with these considerations in mind—reading with a purpose—can give you a deeper appreciation and understanding of the book than you would likely get from reading it on your own on vacation.

### Guidelines: Analyzing the Purpose of Reading As you read a text, consider these questions:
- What was the instructor’s purpose in assigning this text?
- How does this argument relate to the topic or questions currently being
considered in the course?
- How does the text’s particular topic or question relate to the overall goals and themes of the course?
- How does the reading relate to others that have been assigned?
- What is the importance of the text in the course? (Is it required reading? Are you spending a lot of class time on it? Does your instructor refer to it frequently? Will it play a major role in assignments or in exams?)

## Identifying the Genre of a Text
In addition to context, readers must recognize and respect a text’s genre in order to understand it well. The word “genre” (from the French word for “kind” or “sort”) refers to the literary category to which a text belongs. The novel—a lengthy fictional narrative or story in prose — is one genre. The essay — generally a brief, nonfiction composition that discusses a limited subject — is another genre. There are countless genres and subgenres — tragic plays, romance novels, Facebook updates, comic books, scholarly articles, blogs, Web sites, tweets, textbooks — and their existence allows readers to know roughly what to expect from a text before they begin reading. College courses assign texts from a wide variety of genres; understanding something about the differences among them can help you adopt an appropriate reading strategy.

### Guidelines: Analyzing Your Motives for Reading
The following questions can help you focus on your motives for reading a particular text.
- What do you personally hope to learn?
- What particular interests and ideas do you bring to the reading?
- How does the reading relate to your goals for your education? To your particular interests and concerns? To your own experience, academic or general?
- How will the reading help you in your coursework?

Table 1.1 provides a simplified overview of genres. Probably not all the texts you read will fit into these few categories, but the table shows that genre greatly influences how you read. For example, you read textbooks for college courses differently from the way you read novels for pleasure, and you read news articles to understand world events differently from the way you read blogs to learn about an individual’s experience or opinion. Some texts you read quickly, some slowly. Some you must read with great attention, taking notes and marking up the text; others you can read more casually, sometimes just skimming. Ultimately, your purpose — your needs — determines the way you read.

Table 1.1 Types of Sources and Their Characteristics

| Genre | Typical Focus | Typical Author | Typical Audience | Reading Strategy |
:-------|:--------------|:---------------|:-----------------|:-----------------|
| Textbook (such as this one) |  Widely accepted facts and theories | A scholar in the discipline | Undergraduate students | Read chiefly for information |
| Article from a scholarly journal (such as the *New England Journal of Medicine*) | Specific problem or question in the discipline | Specialist in a particular discipline | Other specialists in that discipline | Read for thesis; weigh the argument |
| Classic text or “great book” (such as *Moby Dick*) | Human experience | Major author or thinker from the past | Educated general reader | Read for themes and perspectives
| Contemporary nonfiction essay (from a magazine such as the *New Yorker*) | Human experience; social, political, and cultural issues | Professional writer, scholar, or journalist | General reader | Read for insight into the subject |
| Contemporary poetry and fiction (such as *The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo*) | Human experience | Professional writer | General reader | Read for themes and perspectives |
| Journalistic essay or opinion article ( from a periodical such as *Time* magazine) | Topical issues; social and political problems | Professional journalist | General reader | Read for argument and information |
| Blog (on a Web site) | Individual opinion or experience | Professional or amateur writer | General reader | Read to understand point of view |

Genres are really sets of assumptions that writers and readers share concerning the nature and purpose of a text. Having an awareness of genre will prevent you from reading a scholarly article as though it were simply a source of information, or an essay as though it were simply a newspaper report.

## Clearing Space to Concentrate
In today’s “wired” world, we need to be more deliberate about clearing a space for attentive reading than we did just a few years ago. It takes a positive effort now to set aside thirty minutes or an hour to concentrate on a task without the distraction or temptation of text messages, phone calls, e-mail, TV, chat roulette, and who-knows-what’s-next. But it’s worth the effort because we read so much better and, in fact, more efficiently when we fully immerse ourselves in it — not for just a minute or two at a time, but for an extended period (thirty minutes or an hour at a time). We’d all like to believe that we’re capable multitaskers, but research suggests that, like driving, reading requires the mind’s full attention. (A recent study found that heavy multitaskers actually perform worse than the average person, even though they feel more confident of their ability.[^3])

If you find it difficult to stay focused for thirty minutes at a time, try just ten minutes or even five. With practice, you will gradually be able to increase the length of your sessions. (Use a timer. If your phone has a timer, for now use it only as a timer!) Even if you find that ten minutes or so is your limit, you can schedule several sessions an hour with short breaks in between and get the work done more efficiently than if you allow distractions and interruptions.

The right space for reading is also important — with good lighting and a good chair that encourages an upright posture. Not surprisingly, many students discover (sooner or later) that the library affords a better space than home or a dorm room and that in the library they can do better work and do it more quickly, thanks to the freedom from distractions.

Unfortunately, you will occasionally come across an academic text that is hard to understand simply because it is badly written. But more often, academic texts are difficult because they discuss difficult ideas—those that are subtle, complex, and finely nuanced. Such texts unavoidably make demands on the reader’s attention and patience. For students, the difficulty can be even greater because many course readings were originally intended not for general readers or even undergraduates but for other specialists in the author’s field, who speak the language of the discipline and are familiar with all its terms, concepts, assumptions, and problems. When writing for fellow specialists, scholars do not have to explain the whole context and background of their research, as they might for the general reader; instead, they explore problems and explain their insights in all their complexity and richness, without compromise. Although such texts can be bewildering and frustrating at first, it would be a mistake to conclude that such writing is simply “too difficult.” Even if some passages remain a little puzzling, you can still learn a tremendous amount from them, especially with a little persistence and a good reading strategy.

A few other sources of difficulty are worth noting, having to do with diction, sentence structure, and tone. Academic writers sometimes use familiar words in unfamiliar ways, and words that have one meaning in ordinary speech may have another meaning in a scholarly context. (For example, a scholar of eighteenth-century British literature might use the word “sublime” in a technical sense. In ordinary speech, it usually means “very beautiful,” but a literary critic might use it, as did Edmund Burke and some other eighteenth- and nineteenth-century theorists, to refer specifically to the aspect of things that provokes an irrational response in the beholder; by contrast, the critic might use the word “beautiful” to refer to the aspect that provokes a rational response.) Stay alert for familiar words that are being used in specialized senses. In many cases, a good college-level or unabridged dictionary will explain these alternative meanings; occasionally, you might need to refer to a specialized dictionary (see p. 000).

Complicated ideas often require complicated and lengthy sentence structures. This type of writing is necessary when a good deal of qualification is needed to convey ideas precisely, but it requires readers to hold one idea in their heads while other ideas gather round to modify, expand, limit, and revise it. Paraphrasing or mapping long sentences in a notebook or word processing document may help to clarify or untangle them. (Mind-mapping software, such as XMind, FreeMind, or SimpleMind, can be useful for mapping sentences.)

Finally, look for shifts in tone that may affect the text’s meaning. Academic writers, no less than other writers, employ humor, annoyance, skepticism, gravity, sarcasm — the whole spectrum of intonations — to express ideas and persuade readers. But because difficult texts demand so much of us, especially the first time we read them, we may miss subtle shifts in tone. Since we cannot literally hear the writer’s voice, we must detect such shifts purely from written clues. For example, in “Is Google Making Us Stupid?,” Nicholas Carr describes the ideal search engine imagined by the creators of Google, Sergey Brin and Larry Page, by referencing HAL, the mutinous humanoid computer portrayed in the film 2001: A Space Odyssey (and in the Arthur C. Clarke novels on which the film is based): Carr calls it a “HAL-like machine that might be connected directly to our brains,” and he quotes Brin and Page speculating about artificial brains that would give us constant access to “all the world’s information.” In the following paragraph, Carr remarks,

>Such an ambition is a natural one, even an admirable one, for a pair of math whizzes with vast quantities of cash at their disposal and a small army of computer scientists in their employ. A fundamentally scientific enterprise, Google is motivated by a desire to use technology, in Eric Schmidt’s words, “to solve problems that have never been solved before,” and artificial intelligence is the hardest problem out there. Why wouldn’t Brin and Page want to be the ones to crack it?

Although Carr uses terms that, on the surface, might seem to express nothing but esteem for Google’s founders, he subtly undercuts the praise by hinting that Brin and Page might be dangerous, ambition-crazed crackpots, like Dr. Evil in Austin Powers: “a pair of math whizzes with vast quantities of cash at their disposal and a small army of computer scientists in their employ.” By exploiting the widespread suspicion that “math whizzes” may not be entirely well adjusted, Carr injects a tone of irony or humorous, gentle sarcasm into the paragraph, in keeping with his larger argument that Google and the browsing mentality that the Web engenders may be harming us and our society in ways that tend to escape our notice. In the closing paragraph, Carr returns to HAL and its humanlike intelligence, but now his tone is earnest: “as we come to rely on computers to mediate our understanding of the world, it is our own intelligence that flattens into artificial intelligence.” Seen in this light, we realize that (in Carr’s view) Brin and Page’s ambitions for Google may threaten to deprive us of an essential aspect of our humanity. Unless we are reading carefully and picking up on Carr’s tone, we might fail to recognize the connection between these two paragraphs and the way both belong to a single, consistent argument.

Throughout this book, we use the word argument in a particular sense, referring not to a debate that ends with a winner and a loser but to a kind of logical structure. The Oxford English Dictionary defines “argument” in this sense as “a connected series of statements or reasons intended to establish a position.” The way that statements and reasons are connected, the way that evidence supports claims and one claim supports another, makes it possible to speak of the structure of an argument, even the “architecture” of an argument.

In any free society, and especially in a liberal democracy such as the United States, argument in this sense plays an essential and conspicuous role. Barring physical force, the only way to get citizens to do something or believe something is through persuasion. Candidates for political office must persuade voters to support their platforms. Once elected, politicians must persuade one another to support legislation. In the judicial system, lawyers must persuade judges and juries to convict or release the accused, or to rule in favor of a client. The health of the political and judicial systems depends greatly on citizens’ ability to distinguish between a strong argument and a weak one.

Moreover, arguments in the form of advertisements drive the economy. Many corporations live or die by their ability to persuade consumers to buy their products. Every advertisement presents an argument of some kind, whether bold or subtle, aimed at convincing members of the audience to spend money on the company’s product—or at least to give the company a few seconds of their attention. Americans are bombarded with advertisements, thousands a day according to some estimates.[^4] A century ago, advertisers would pitch their products with slogans that now seem obvious and crude (“Dooley’s Yeast Powder. The Best. Try It”). Today, most advertisers use more subtle and indirect approaches, hoping to create positive associations with the product in the viewer’s mind or to sell an idea that will ultimately lead to some sort of behavior.

Figure 1.1 This straightforward ad contains a complex argument. (Source: Ad Council)

Let’s take a look at an advertisement and examine its argument. Figure 1.1 shows a billboard image that was used in an Ad Council campaign for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. This apparently simple ad is not selling a product, but it is selling something: the idea that driving while “buzzed” — that is, with a blood alcohol concentration high enough to impair but not enough to make a driver feel positively drunk — is extremely costly. Since drivers on the highway can only glance quickly at billboards, it must be possible to take in the image and text in a second or two. Yet an effective ad will somehow stick with the viewer and have a lasting impact; in this case, the goal is to change the viewer’s behavior.

All we see here is an image of a man in his twenties or thirties blowing into a breathalyzer, and beside it the brief white-on-black phrase, “You just blew $10,000.” The man is well groomed and clean shaven, but unremarkable — an everyman that many viewers, particularly young men, could probably identify with. He looks worried, perhaps even bewildered, his eyes not focused on the police officer or the breathalyzer or anything in particular, as if he’s thinking only about the mess he’s in. It’s clearly nighttime, but he is brightly lit: a harsh yellowish light shines from the right, as if he is in the glare of a spotlight. Unfocused colored lights twinkle in the distance. The police officer is out of focus too, and almost out of the picture, but the figure “.08” on the breathalyzer is crisply legible.

The words “You just blew $10,000,” in all caps, shout directly at us, because we read “you,” not “he.” Beneath this we read another phrase in smaller, lowercase type: “Buzzed driving is drunk driving.” Perhaps the first thing to register is the obvious pun on the word “blew”: blowing .08 into a breathalyzer can mean blowing a large sum of money. But what does this figure of $10,000 refer to? The second sentence doesn’t explain. Most drivers know that the actual fine for a DUI (driving under the influence) offense is likely to be much less, at least for a first offense. So it presents a puzzle: How does that number make sense? Many viewers will probably soon guess that it must be a rough estimate of all the costs resulting from a DUI conviction: fines, towing, bail, legal fees, increased insurance rates. (Those who visit the Web site cited at the bottom of the billboard will find videos that explain the amount as the total of the “fines, legal fees, and increased insurance costs” resulting from a DUI conviction.) Importantly, however, the ad has forced the viewer to think, if only for a few moments longer than it takes to read the billboard, about the high monetary cost of a DUI — even if there’s no collision, and no one is injured. In a sense, the sign is interactive, and therefore memorable.
The number displayed on the breathalyzer and the phrase “Buzzed driving is drunk driving” suggest that you don’t have to feel positively drunk to have broken the law and get arrested: with a .08 blood alcohol concentration you might feel merely “buzzed.” The assumption behind the ad seems to be that the potential hit to the wallet will have a greater impact on the target audience than would other deterrents, such as bodily harm suffered in an accident. That may seem cynical, but many drivers believe that they can drive pretty safely after a couple of drinks and won’t cause a collision. The ad argues — with great economy but considerable force — that even if that’s true, getting arrested can still cause a lot of pain.

Political speeches, legal speeches, and commercials exist in order to persuade, but other kinds of texts also make arguments, though argument may not be their only purpose. Films and novels often make arguments. For example, the film Avatar might be said to argue that our modern, industrial civilization’s objectification and exploitation of the natural world cannot be reconciled with the longer-term need to live harmoniously with it. Sculptures and paintings make arguments — for example, about what we should consider good or noble or beautiful. In arguments like these, the claim being made is implied rather than stated. But the argument exists nevertheless, and it may be powerful.

For instance, in Figure 1.2, a photograph of the Freedmen’s Memorial in Washington, D.C., a nameless slave stoops at the feet of Abraham Lincoln, apparently paying tribute to him. Lincoln is emancipating him, signing a proclamation with his right hand and sweeping his left hand over the slave’s head. The figures are slightly larger than life and stand on a column about seven feet high. The sculpture makes an argument about the historical significance of the Emancipation Proclamation, certainly, but in doing so, it makes other claims as well. For example, Lincoln stands upright, as though solely responsible for the emancipation of slaves. The slave, though finally free, still kneels at the feet of a powerful white man. Of course, viewers can draw their own conclusions, but the sculpture — created by Thomas Ball only a decade after the end of the Civil War — does appear to invite the viewer to remember the emancipation of slaves in ways that today would make many of us uneasy.

We can even speak of the argument of a piece of music, such as a movement in a symphony, even if the piece has no words. Here the term would refer to the way that a composer varies and develops musical ideas — themes and phrases — such that the piece has a structure something like that of a written text. And just as music listeners or viewers of visual works of art must often look for an implied argument, so readers of texts sometimes encounter arguments that remain unstated. At times, a text that seems to be simply telling a story, or a series of stories, is actually making an argument. Consider Geoff Dyer’s “Blues for Vincent” (p. 000), an unusual essay in four scenes, or perhaps “panels,” that clearly relate to one another but in no simple way. At the end of the essay, we become aware that it has been making an argument, and that the last two or three sentences perhaps express that argument in the manner of a thesis statement. Or perhaps not quite: maybe the argument cannot be contained in that way, being so thoroughly entangled in the feelings of sorrow and consolation that emerge only from the stories themselves. The argument may be hard to pin down (is it about the blues? love? pain? cubism?), but that does not mean that no argument is there.

::: details Analyzing an Advertisement
Find an ad, either in a magazine or from television. Study it closely (no detail is insignificant). What claim does the advertisement make? What evidence (implied or stated) does the ad offer for this claim? In your notebook, write out the argument of the ad as fully and accurately as you can. Now, assess this argument. In your view, is the argument rational or irrational? Logical or emotional? Some combination? Neither?

## Reading Critically
We said earlier that readers must first listen carefully to what the text is saying, but we have also spoken of the importance of entering into a dialogue with the text: at some point, readers must go beyond just listening if they want to develop a response. Even if readers primarily listen first and figure out their ideas about the text later, both of these activities are part of what we mean by “reading critically.” The difference is really a matter of emphasis, since it’s impossible to separate them completely: it is impossible not to reflect, weigh, and even react as you read, even for the first time. (The eighteenth-century Irish statesman Edmund Burke once observed, “To read without reflecting is like eating without digesting.”) “Listening” carefully to what the author has to say produces an understanding of the text that inevitably reflects something of your own priorities, interests, and even personality. As such, it becomes the basis of your response.

So good readers take into account the context in which the piece was written and its genre. They attempt to look at the question through the writer’s eyes, and they strive to give some thought to what the argument means to them personally. But good reading does not end there. A reader’s responsibility is not only to understand a writer’s point of view but also to test it, to see whether the argument holds up under close scrutiny. Put another way, a reader’s responsibility is not only to the writer but also to the truth: if every reader simply accepted every writer’s claims without question, as if they were the last word on the subject, humankind’s quest for understanding would come to an abrupt halt. Only by noticing errors, weaknesses, and limitations in arguments that have already been made by others do we become able to improve on those arguments and get a little closer to the truth. Most writers actually value this kind of critical reading because they see their work not as an end in itself but as a contribution to a larger project, a project of figuring out the answer to a question or the solution to a problem, and this greater goal is one that they share with their readers. In this sense, a critical reader who can see the shortcomings in an argument and correct them is the best reader a writer can hope for. (Note how different this is from merely passing judgment — saying “I liked it” or “I didn’t like it.” Such blanket judgments don’t get us very far.)

But can you, as a first-year college student, raise valid questions against an argument made by an expert? Most of the time, yes. In some situations, you might simply have to take an expert’s word for it. But for the most part, if you can make sense of the argument, you can also analyze and assess it. Your knowledge of the subject may be more limited, but you do bring learning and valuable experience to your reading. Your unique perspective may enable you to see something an expert has overlooked. Moreover, you are a reasonable creature, and you can be observant and sensitive, so you are capable of recognizing when something doesn’t make sense, when some aspect of the question has been carelessly or superficially argued, or when an important point has been neglected. Questioning whether an argument makes sense is a necessary part of figuring out how it makes sense: when an argument doesn’t make good sense to you, even after you’ve considered it carefully, you have as much right as anyone to say so and to explain your misgivings.

## The Principle of Charity
But don’t be too hasty to criticize! Good readers also observe the principle of charity. This principle simply states that, as readers, we ought to give the author a chance before we leap in with criticisms and questions. If we find ourselves struggling with a text, we should assume, at least provisionally, that such difficulties stem chiefly from the nature of the ideas being explored, not from the failings of the writer. And we should bring reasonable expectations to the text: a few writers are able to cast their every thought in crystal-clear prose, but we should not expect everyone with good ideas to achieve perfection all the time. So the principle of charity dictates that readers should, within reason, allow for human frailty and accept that even if the writing might be clearer, the text may still be worth reading. (Of course, at the end of the day, you may be forced to conclude that the text was not, in fact, worth the time and effort—but if you make such a judgment before you’re sure it’s fair, you may be cheating both the writer and yourself.)

The principle of charity has another, more positive aspect. It implies that, to be really good readers, we must temporarily surrender ourselves to the text and let it do its work on us. That is, we must give the writer a chance and, for a time, imagine how the question looks from the writer’s point of view. The English romantic poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge wrote in 1817 that poetry requires the “willing suspension of disbelief ”; just as poetry and fiction demand that we allow our imaginations to carry us away from our own worlds and into a world created by another, so nonfiction also demands a certain willingness to entertain another person’s ideas, and even to immerse ourselves in them. (In “Blues for Vincent” [p. 000], Geoff Dyer writes, “The blues is . . . not something you play but a way of calling out to the dead, to all the dead slaves of America.” On its own, the claim might seem outlandish, but he has given us, in a few short scenes, a way of understanding his point of view, of hearing in the blues what he hears.) Eventually, of course, we will need to consider the text in a more detached and critical way, but on a first reading the suspension of disbelief is a useful strategy: the deeper our understanding of the author’s position, the more well-founded and persuasive our response will be — even if our position differs.

Is it possible to be a sympathetic reader and a critical reader at the same time? Absolutely. Experienced critical readers tend to seesaw as they read, shifting their perspective back and forth, first asking themselves “What does the writer mean?” and then “Does this really make good sense?” The modernist poet and critic T. S. Eliot used the terms “surrender” and “recovery” for this kind of mental circling: readers must first surrender to the text, accepting its way of looking at things, but in good time they must recover their own mind and judge whether this way of looking is acceptable or valid. In this phase, the reader asks questions such as “What is the author failing to see? How else might the question be considered? What are the unstated implications of this argument?”

Clearly, readers who write have many things to do: listen carefully to what the author is saying, taking into account the historical and cultural context; trace the argument and its logical structure; reflect on the argument and start weighing it; begin to think about what they might have to say in response. Readers do not need to do all these things at once, however: that’s what rereading is for. And in the next two chapters, we’ll offer several strategies for getting all these reading tasks done, effectively and efficiently.

Most students are, in effect, professional readers, and reading plays a central role in the vast majority of college courses. A 2012 national survey of first-year college students showed that 73 percent are assigned at least five books or book-length packs of course readings. Thirty-three percent are assigned eleven or more books, and 11 percent are assigned more than twenty.[^5]

Your success as a student depends to a great extent on how efficient and capable you are as a reader. And if you think of “success” in education as the attainment of greater wisdom, discernment, and maturity rather than just a matter of grades and credentials, then the way in which you read becomes an even more critical matter. The kind of education you receive — or perhaps “achieve” is the better word — depends not only on what you read but also on how you read. To read attentively, thoughtfully, critically remains an essential skill. In this age of the Internet, information is readily available in vast quantities, but its sheer abundance has made the ability to discriminate between the useful and the not so useful, between the reliable and the dubious, more valuable than ever. “Active reading” means bringing your whole mind to bear on a text, in order to comprehend the text’s meaning, to place that meaning in relation to the rest of what you know, and to step back from it to assess its strengths and weaknesses. In the following chapter, we will look at the fundamental strategies for putting this lofty ideal into practice.
