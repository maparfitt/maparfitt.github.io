# Developing an Argument

## Argument as Structure
“The aim of argument, or of discussion, should not be victory, but progress.” JOSEPH JOUBERT

If you were to build a house, a barn, or a cathedral — any structure meant to last — you would need not only good materials but also an understanding of structural and architectural principles. You would need to know how to arrange spaces that serve people’s needs, how to place doors and windows, how to make the walls and roof strong enough to withstand ice and rain and wind. Developing an argument is similar. Of course, you need materials, like ideas and quotations and notes, but you also need an understanding of the principles that make it possible to bring the various parts together to form a structure that holds up, that invites readers in and leads them through its points, and that can withstand careful scrutiny. Like the best buildings, the best arguments are sturdy, well proportioned, and pleasing. Achieving these goals requires an understanding of some basic principles of logic and rhetoric.
To this point our focus has been chiefly on reading, note-taking, and informal writing — work that generates the sort of ideas you can use for an essay or other piece of writing. By now you should have some sense of what you want to say, so this chapter focuses on planning, designing, and assembling an argument. To construct a strong argument, writers must understand argument’s component parts and how these parts relate to one another. In the fourth century BCE, the Greek philosopher Aristotle distinguished between two aspects of argumentation: logic (systematic reasoning) and rhetoric (the art of persuasion). You might think of logic as the invisible interior principles that hold an argument together — like the structural principles that keep a building standing — and rhetoric as the external features that make it attractive. This chapter is concerned primarily with logic — with making the argument fundamentally sound. (Rhetoric, the art of making an argument appealing, is discussed in the next chapter.)

## The Components of Argument: Motive, Claim, and Support
As you will recall from Chapter 1 (p. 00), we use the word “argument” here not in the sense of a two-sided dispute in which one opponent tries to defeat the other, but in the sense of a single logical structure in which one individual makes an argument. Like any structure, arguments have several component parts—namely, motive, claim, and support.

### Motive
We noted in the Introduction that academic essays usually offer a solution or partial solution to a problem, a question, or an issue of some kind. Very often, this problem (or question or issue) also interests other scholars in the field; the writer will usually mention or explain it in the first paragraph or two. This reference to a problem reveals the writer’s purpose and suggests why readers might want to pay attention to the essay. In other words, it explains the argument’s “motive”: its basic purpose or reason for existing. (As we noted in Chapter 4, sometimes the problem, question, or issue is implied rather than stated outright. But if so, the reader can usually figure it out.)

Academic writing is often concerned with problems of an intellectual nature—we might call them “knowledge problems”—rather than practical problems. In many academic disciplines, the job of researchers is to expand our understanding of the world, so their work seeks to answer questions and solve problems at the cutting edge of knowledge. Some practical usefulness might appear somewhere down the road, but often the main reason for solving the problem is simply to satisfy human curiosity. In the academic world, this is motive enough. Arguments published in magazines and newspapers, typically intended for general readers rather than professional researchers, are more usually concerned with practical problems.

While a concern with knowledge problems is a distinctive feature of academic work, academic writing can also focus on practical problems. College writing assignments in particular often ask students to address practical problems: for example, political problems (“Should the electoral college be abolished?”), social problems (“How can American cities best deal with homelessness?”), or technological and engineering problems (“How can a smarter robot be built?”). Whether you are dealing with an intellectual problem or a practical one, you will need to provide a strong sense of the problem, question, or issue you are addressing so that the reader can understand why your argument matters and is worth reading.

### Claim
Every argument, including academic arguments, proposes some idea to readers—the solution to a problem, the answer to a question, the correct approach to an issue. In other words, it makes a claim — an assertion that something is true or valid.

A claim differs from a fact in that a claim awaits proof or strong evidence, while a fact has already been well established. For example, the following is a claim:

>Information comes to seem like an environment.
(Sven Birkerts, “Reading in a Digital Age”)

This is a novel idea, one that readers might not accept without some sort of supporting evidence. However, the sentence that comes next in Birkerts’s article can be called a fact because it describes a familiar experience that readers are likely to accept without further argument or support: “If anything ‘important’ happens anywhere, we will be informed.”

On its own, a claim leaves the reader wondering, “Why should I believe that?” or “Why is that true?” A claim is yet to be proven, just as a claim that you stake on something, such as a piece of land, has not yet been fulfilled: it is a demand that you’re expecting to be fulfilled at some later time. A claim hangs in the balance, waiting to be proven or disproven.

A claim is also different from an opinion, though the difference can be subtle. When you express an opinion—for
example, “I think it is wrong to conduct experiments on animals,” or “In my opinion, it was a terrible performance,” or “I believe that most people are basically good” — you just state a belief, and it may or may not be possible or necessary to make a rational argument for it. It could be an expression of taste, bias, or faith, perhaps a feeling or a hunch — that brussels sprouts are delicious, that Cameron Diaz is the greatest actor ever, that capital punishment is murder — and you are not asserting that your belief is objectively “true.” But when you make a claim, you do state it as true. You’re prepared, at least in theory, to back it up. Here are several actual claims.

>There is no fundamental difference between man and the higher animals in their mental faculties. (Charles Darwin, *The Descent of Man*)

>To the frontier the American intellect owes its striking characteristics. (Frederick Jackson Turner, “The Significance
of the Frontier in American History”)

>The current design revolution recognizes that sensory experience is as valid a part of our nature as our capacity to speak or to reason. (Virginia Postrel, “The Design of Your Life”)

>It’s an overwrought Gothic melodrama that has a nice first act before it descends into shameless absurdity. (Roger Ebert, review of the film *Asylum*)

These claims come from very different sources, but each one requires a supporting argument to persuade the reader that it is valid or true. On their own, they aren’t either valid or invalid, true or false. (You can probably imagine directly contrary claims that might be made.)

::: details Working with Claims
1. Make up supporting statements for each of the claims listed above. Use your imagination, or search for facts that provide strong support.

2. Make up three or four claims of your own. Discuss them in class: What sort of support does each require? (Some possible topics: the effect on children of two working parents; the right to text while driving; the dangers of mixed martial arts or “ultimate fighting”; the need for print journalism in the Internet age.)
:::

### Support
Without support (evidence and reasoning), claims are no more than a series of assertions, backed by nothing (such claims are called “empty claims”). If readers have no reason to believe them, claims lack all force and impact. So support is essential. But what counts as support? Support includes both evidence, such as data and facts, and reasoning, a sequence of logically connected statements. There are only two requirements for support: first, it must be valid in itself; second, it must be relevant to the claim. Consider the following one-sentence arguments:

>Animals should be treated humanely because they are just like you and me.

>Animals should be treated humanely because at least 60 percent of American households include a pet.

In the first example, the claim that “animals should be treated humanely” is supported by a statement that is not necessarily valid in itself. (Are all animals “just like” you and me? Are any?) In the second example, the claim is supported by a statistic that may well be accurate but is irrelevant: Why should this fact mean that all animals should be treated humanely?

A stronger argument might go something like this:

>Animals should be treated humanely because they feel pain as acutely as humans do; moreover, scientists have shown that animals also experience similar emotional distress, including feelings of shame, loss, and depression.

(Of course, this argument holds up only if scientists have in fact shown all this. The relevant studies would need to be cited.)
Support gives us a reason (or reasons) for believing a claim to be true, but it is not the same thing as absolute proof. (In fact, proofs are rarely, if ever, 100 percent airtight, except perhaps in mathematics.) We can rarely prove arguments; all we can do is support them as strongly as possible. There will always be some room for doubt.

Still, in the strongest arguments, the relation between claims and their support is a tight fit, so tight as to be virtually irrefutable. In a weak argument, there are holes in the reasoning, gaps between the claims and the support and between different claims. Objections can easily be raised. The whole structure comes tumbling down under the least pressure.

## A Typical Workflow
Writing an essay isn’t like following a recipe: it’s a creative enterprise, and individual writers eventually develop their own processes that work for them. But it is possible to describe a typical writing process, and the graphic below shows a standard workflow for academic writing. As we’ve already seen, the writing process begins with active reading and note-taking, and that is usually followed by informal writing to develop ideas. Now we’ve come to the next stage, which is normally to draft a working thesis statement and then begin developing an argument, perhaps with an outline. Later in this chapter, we’ll discuss some strategies for drafting paragraphs, and in Chapter 6 we’ll discuss strategies for refining the organization and clarifying the argument.

## Drafting a Thesis Statement
Arguments can be short and simple — a single claim and some support for the claim.
Come with me to the hockey game. Our star defenseman has finally recovered from his injuries and will be in the starting lineup.
THECLAIM: You should come with me to the hockey game. THESUPPORT: Our star defenseman will be in the starting lineup.
But academic arguments are more lengthy and complicated than this example, so they need a “master claim” to keep them focused and organized. We call this master claim the thesis statement. The body of the essay typically provides support for this master claim, support that will include many other claims — supporting claims — along the way. The thesis statement is often presented in one or two sentences somewhere near the beginning, usually toward the end of the first or second paragraph. It represents the argument boiled down to its essence — a single claim that shows what the essay contributes toward the solution of a problem or that reveals the author’s stand on an issue.

The purpose of all the thinking you do while rereading, taking notes, and doing exploratory writing is to produce an idea that you’d like to present in an essay — a thesis. If you feel that you still don’t have anything to say, return to the strategies discussed in Chapters 2, 3, and 4. (Sometimes the creative process can be a struggle. There’s no fail-safe formula for generating ideas, but the strategies and activities that we’ve discussed in these chapters should move the process forward.)

If you do have a sense of what you want to say, even a vague one, it’s time to draft a working thesis statement. Think of your working thesis statement as a building tool: it will help you develop your argument even if it has to be substantially revised several times during the writing process. You need not feel committed to your words at this point, but your working thesis statement will give you a sense of direction as you begin developing an argument.

## The Role of the Thesis Statement
As you begin thinking about a working thesis statement, it will be helpful to remember what a thesis statement is and isn’t.

The word “thesis” is an ancient Greek term that originally referred to the stressed syllables in a line of poetry or stressed notes in a musical phrase, and to the beating of a hand or foot in time to a rhythm. Eventually, it came to be used for statements that were “put forth” or “put down” in a related way, often in a debate or conversation. This sense is still implied in its modern usage. Just as we sometimes use the expressions “Let me float this idea” or “Let me put this thought out there,” the word “thesis” suggests an idea that a writer wants to test or try out. (Similarly, the word “essay” comes from the French verb essayer, meaning “to try or test.”)

This nuanced meaning of “thesis” is useful to keep in mind as you sketch out a working thesis. Student writers are sometimes tempted to play it safe, feeling that they ought to have the “right answer” to a problem, even if their idea is self-evident or one that anyone else in the class might have come up with. But to construct a lengthy argument to support an obvious point is a waste of your time as well as your reader’s. And an essay assignment is not like an exam: instructors rarely expect a “right answer.” When they read exams, instructors usually expect to find a certain sameness; but when they read essays, instructors look forward to reading as many different arguments as there are students in the class.

A thesis statement is much more than a topic or general subject. It suggests what the essay seeks to accomplish rather than merely what it talks about. A topic is static and lifeless — it makes no particular assertion and needs no proof. But a thesis statement—as a type of claim—requires a supporting argument. And it relates to a recognized problem, question, or issue — it has a motive. Thus a thesis has an energy and a direction that will keep the essay moving forward.

For example, “the problem of greenhouse gas emissions” is a possible topic. Here’s a thesis statement from a student essay:
Congress can take several effective measures to diminish the emission of dangerous greenhouse gases, without limiting either the freedom or the prosperity of American citizens. (Student writer Amy Britten)

In her opening paragraph, this writer had explained the problem: greenhouse gases contribute to global warming, which scientists agree is changing the climate more quickly than living things can adapt to such changes. She then proposed that part of the solution may be action on the part of the federal government, as action can be taken without great cost to America’s freedom or prosperity. So the essay’s motive is clear. But the thesis calls out for a supporting argument: the reader needs to know not only what specific measures the writer is proposing but also how these measures can be implemented without diminishing the freedom or prosperity of American citizens.

Here are some further examples of thesis statements from actual academic essays and articles, some by students and some by professional scholars. Note how each of these makes an original claim, related to a problem, a question, or an issue. Each leaves support for later, prompty the reader to wonder, “Really? Now, why should you think that, and why should I agree with you?”

>Racial caste is alive and well in America.
(Michelle Alexander, “Drug War Nightmare: How We Created a Massive Racial Caste System in America”)

>In today’s society, [video games] consistently fulfill genuine human needs that the real world fails to satisfy. More than that, they may prove to be a key resource for solving some of our most pressing real-world problems. (Jane McGonigal, “Be a Gamer, Save the World”)

>Why is it that so many of us are obese? . . . Although answers are beginning to emerge, there can be no meaningful discussion of the subject until we resist the impulse to assign blame. Nor can we hold to the simple belief that with willpower alone, one can consciously resist the allure of food and precisely control one’s weight. Instead, we must look at the facts dispassionately and uninfluenced by the numerous competing interests that drive debate on this subject. (Jeffrey M. Friedman, “A War on Obesity, Not the Obese”)

>The athletics scholarship must be abandoned in favor of institutional need-based aid. The athletics scholarship at its foundation is the biggest barrier to athletes’ getting a genuine educational opportunity. When you are paid to play, regardless of the form of “payment,” everything takes a back seat to athletic performance. (John R. Gerdy, “For True Reform, Athletics Scholarships Must Go”)

>Although a supporter of states’ rights and the Missouri Compromise, President Franklin Pierce signed the Kansas-Nebraska bill into law because he believed that the advantages of a transcontinental railroad were worth the political price: the potential benefits to the country outweighed the anger that the repeal of the Compromise would surely provoke. (Student writer Zach Peikon)

>Jane Tompkins’s main argument is that reflecting seriously about history is a personal moral responsibility. But instead of just stating this argument, Tompkins shows the reader what this means and demonstrates how to do it. In the end, the essay’s meaning is to be found more in what Tompkins does than in what she says. It presents its “moral” more in the indirect way that films or plays or even paintings do than in the direct way that most scholarly essays do.
(Student writer Diana Taylor)

>We wish to put forward a radically different structure for the salt of deoxyribose nucleic acid. This structure has two helical chains each coiled round the same axis. ( James Watson and Francis Crick, “A Structure for Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid”)

>Credentialing, not educating, has become the primary business of North American universities. (Jane Jacobs, “Credentialing versus Educating”)

To sum up, a thesis statement helps readers recognize an essay’s purpose and point, but it also serves the needs of writers during the writing process, in that it gives them a clear sense of their argument’s direction and helps them stay in control of their purpose. As you draft your working thesis for the first time, bear in mind that a good thesis has two qualities, which work in tandem:

1. It is fresh, insightful, and interesting.
2. It can be supported with evidence and strong reasoning.

These two criteria are equally necessary: a thesis should not be so “interesting” or far-fetched as to be insupportable, nor should it be supportable but obvious or trivial. Just as an argument that states only the obvious is a waste of time, so are arguments that are merely frivolous or facetious.

### Drafting the Argument
As you begin drafting an argument to support your thesis, you’ll need to consider the various strategies you can employ to persuade a reader that your thesis is valid. As we’ve noted, an argument cannot be merely a series of claims, nor can it be just a collection of facts, statistics, or quotations. An argument must combine claims and support; more exactly, it must support its claims with evidence and reasoning. In academic writing, this support is expected to be particularly strong. So let’s review some of the main ways of supporting claims in order to obtain a clearer sense of those that are most appropriate to academic writing.

### The Modes of Persuasion: Ethos, Pathos, and Logos
The philosopher Aristotle identified three “modes” or methods by which writers (or speakers) can persuade readers (or an audience): *ethos* (credibility), *pathos* (emotion), and *logos* (logic or reasoning). That is, a writer might persuade readers by convincing them that he or she is a credible source — sincere, fair, caring, amiable, and so on. Or a writer might persuade by appealing to readers’ emotions, by bringing them to tears, arousing their anger, or stirring their pride. Finally, a writer can persuade readers by appealing to reason, by explaining how the evidence forces them to reach a particular verdict, for example, or by showing that certain conclusions necessarily follow from principles on which they all agree.

In academic writing, logos is normally the dominant mode of persuasion. Yes, an academic essay should show that you are credible (matters like correct spelling, formatting, and grammar suggest that you are a careful writer), but readers are unlikely to be persuaded by ethos alone. And yes, appealing to readers’ emotions might help to bring home a point or convince them that your argument really does matter (a poignant anecdote to clinch your argument in the last couple of paragraphs can be effective), but an academic essay will rarely persuade by pathos alone. Instead, academic arguments persuade primarily by means of logos, because the purpose of academic writing is not to win over the reader by any means, but to seek and offer truth. (The only test for ethos and pathos is whether they have the desired effect. But logos, as Aristotle recognized, obeys its own set of rules — which gave birth to the science of logic and ultimately to the scientific method.) By comparison, ethos and pathos are merely ornamental—not unwelcome, but not the stuff that forms the substance of the argument. It’s worth taking a moment, then, to consider how reasoning and logic — logos — function in academic writing.

### Types of Reasoning
As we noted earlier, an argument is different from a proof. The purpose of academic writing is rarely to prove something, but rather to make an argument that is as convincing as possible, given the available evidence. A good academic essay need not make an argument that is unassailably “right,” but the reader should feel, by the conclusion, that there’s a good chance the argument is right, that its claims are insightful and supported by strong evidence and careful reasoning.

Sound reasoning is essential to academic writing. In developing your argument, you will need to guard against errors of reasoning known as “logical fallacies.” In addition, you must explain your reasoning adequately, so that the steps that lead from one claim to another will be clear to the reader. To create a persuasive argument, make sure that your evidence is valid and supports your claims and that your claims support your thesis.

The science of formal logic, concerned with the precise conditions that produce absolutely valid conclusions from premises, need not concern us in detail. (In fact, real-world arguments rarely meet the strict standards of formal logic.) But it may be helpful to distinguish between two kinds of reasoning — inductive and deductive — and to distinguish between two types of deductive reasoning — the syllogism and the enthymeme.

#### Deduction
Deduction is the term used for deriving a conclusion from other statements, known as premises. Thus, a proof can be formed by building a chain of statements, in which each statement rigorously follows from prior statements.
Syllogism The basic tool of deductive reasoning is the syllogism. Aristotle introduced the syllogism in his Prior Analytics as a means of testing the validity of deductive reasoning. He defined the syllogism as “discourse in which, certain things being stated, something other than what is stated follows of necessity from their being so.”[^1] The words “of necessity” are the key here: The deduced statement does not follow because Aristotle wanted it to, or because the ancient Greeks believed in syllogisms, or because the writer finds some advantage in it. The deduced statement must be true if the other statements are true.
In simple terms, a syllogism contains two related premises and a conclusion. For example:
All humans are mortal. (MAJOR PREMISE) All Greeks are humans. (MINOR PREMISE) Therefore, all Greeks are mortal. (CONCLUSION)

[^1]: Aristotle, “Prior Analytics,” trans. A. J. Jenkinson, in Jonathan Barnes, ed., *The Complete Works of Aristotle: The Revised Oxford Translation,* Bollingen Series 71, Vol. 1 (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1984), 39.

The subject (“Greeks”) and predicate (“mortal”) in the conclusion occur in the premises, and both premises also contain a third term (“humans”) known as the “middle term,” which does not occur in the conclusion. The syllogism functions like a machine for producing truths. If you have two related truths, the syllogism makes it possible to deduce a third, new truth. The next two examples are perhaps a bit more practical.

All drinks containing caffeine affect Michela’s sleep. Cola contains caffeine.
Therefore, cola will affect Michela’s sleep.

All shirts with polka dots are on sale.
All of the shirts on this rack have polka dots. Therefore, all of the shirts on this rack are on sale.

In real life, no one argues by means of strict syllogisms, but they show how the validity of an argument can be tested by means of strict and precise analysis.

Moreover, in reality we rarely find ourselves working with universally true premises, so it is necessary to argue what is probably true, based on probable premises, rather than what’s necessarily true. The point is that you should carefully examine the logic of your deductive reasoning to make sure that your conclusions follow from the premises. Your conclusions don’t need to be absolutely, necessarily valid proofs, but they do need to have a high degree of probability.

##### Enthymeme
In formal logic, one conclusion follows strictly from another, and in the process of deducing conclusions from premises, no steps may be omitted. In real-life arguments, however, we can and do omit steps, expecting readers to supply them. An enthymeme is an informal syllogism, in which one of the premises is missing. In practice, we’re much more likely to say “Caffeinated drinks affect Michela’s sleep, so cola will affect her sleep too” or “Cola contains caffeine, so it will affect Michela’s sleep” than to spell out the entire syllogism. And this works perfectly well, as long as the reader will understand the missing step. So omit only those steps that you can expect the reader to understand.

#### Induction
Induction is the method of reasoning from a part to a whole or from particulars to a generalization. When a scientist gathers data from laboratory experiments and draws a conclusion based on that data, he or she is reasoning inductively — reasoning from particulars to a generalization. Of course, some generalizations have greater validity than others; usually, it all depends on the size of the sample on which the generalization is based. Take this statement, for example: “American cars are more reliable than European cars.” Although this is a broad generalization, a study of the overall reliability of millions of American and European cars might show that it is valid (or invalid). A smaller study would only be able to suggest that it might be valid or invalid.

### Types of Evidence
Evidence includes textual evidence, anecdotes from personal experience, statistics, expert authority, graphs and other visuals, facts, and comparisons or other analogies. Each type has its hazards as well as its strengths (see Table 5.1), and each may be more or less appropriate depending on the assignment and the context.

Table 5.1 Types of Evidence
| Type of evidence | Example | Strengths | Hazards
|----------|----------|----------|----------|
Textual evidence (including quotations, paraphrases, and summaries) | In the end, however, Gopnik celebrates the hectic New York way of life: “Busyness is our art form, our civic ritual, our way of being us” (p. 000).| Expected if the assignment asks you to analyze or “close read” a text. Introduces evidence directly into your essay, showing the reader exactly how you drew your conclusions. | If used excessively, direct quotations can obscure the argument you are making. They must be fully integrated into the argument with analysis and commentary, as they rarely speak for themselves. | 
Stories or anecdotes (including personal anecdotes) | See Carr, in “Is Google Making Us Stupid?”: “Over the past few years I’ve had an uncomfortable sense that someone, or something, has been tinkering with my brain” (p. 000). | Usually engaging, and can be moving, dramatic, powerful. | They often appeal to the emotions (pathos) rather than reason (logos). May be logically weak, as they describe particular instances rather than general truths. | 
Statistics | See Foroohar: “The Pew Charitable Trusts’ Economic Mobility Project has found that if you were born in 1970 in the bottom one-fifth of the socioeconomic spectrum in the U.S., you had only about a 17% chance of making it into the upper two-fifths” (p. 000). | An economical way to summarize a wealth of evidence. | Often abused. They often look compelling but on examination fail to tell the whole story (see Darrell Huff, How to Lie with Statistics). |
Expert authority | Law professor Michelle Alexander contends that, in many ways, African Americans are doing “no better” today than when Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated (p. 000). | Reliable sources, especially leading scholars in a particular field writing in peer-reviewed journals, provide strong evidence. | Is the source reliable? No one is beyond question. Some sources, especially Web sites, may seem more authoritative than they really are. |
Visuals (including graphics that display statistical data) | See Jane McGonigal’s use of a bar graph, “Game Time,” in her article “Be a Gamer, Save the World” (p. 000). | Economical yet often rich. | Use only if they truly strengthen the argument, and never for decorative purposes. |
Facts | See Foroohar, “Whatever Happened to Upward Mobility?”: “Behavioral economics tells us that our sense of well-being is tied not to the past but to how we are doing compared with our peers. Relative mobility matters” (p. 000). | Can be difficult to dispute. At best, they are unambiguous, intelligible, clear. | Facts are often less simple and indisputable than they appear. Cite the source of any fact that is not general knowledge. |
Analogies (including comparisons, metaphors, and similes) | Since fraternities have been able to give up hazing traditions, it is likely that the football team will be able to do likewise. | An analogy uses facts or conditions that the reader acknowledges to draw immediate assent to a new idea. | Must be a very close fit, or they will be confusing and ineffectual. |

As noted earlier, evidence must be both valid (quotations need to be accurate, facts need to be correct, and so on) and relevant to the claim it supports. Sometimes weaker evidence can be combined with other types of evidence to produce reasonably strong support for a claim.

In college writing, the best kind of evidence is often determined by the nature of the assignment. For an assignment that asks for a close reading of one or more texts, the strongest evidence is typically the words on the page. For a research assignment that asks for a study of a local subculture, the strongest evidence might be your direct observations or the testimony of interviewees. Usually, your assignment will either clearly state or strongly hint at the kind of evidence that you are expected to use. If you are unsure, ask your instructor.

### An Argument Matrix
Your notes and informal writing have supplied you with a good deal of raw material to work with. But it is raw. You could simply work through all this material and mark or copy out the ideas you plan to use. But the process of working out arguments to support your thesis—including identifying claims and the evidence to support those claims, and working out possible counterarguments — can be made more efficient by using a simple device called an argument matrix: a document with three columns, headed “Claims,” “Evidence,” and “Discussion.”

The value of an argument matrix is that you can start in any of the three columns, but at some point you will need to enter notes in all three columns to complete the supporting argument. It reminds you to provide evidence, wherever possible, for your claims and to explain that evidence with discussion (evidence doesn’t speak for itself ). For example, in the “Evidence” column, you might list a quotation that you feel supports your argument well. Next, in the “Discussion” column, you might add some sentences that explain why this quotation supports your argument. Finally, after this work has clarified how the quotation works in relation to your argument, you can formulate a claim in the “Claims” column. Or you might begin with a claim that you believe to be true and then locate the evidence (a quotation or a fact) that supports the claim.

This method also helps to prevent inadvertent plagiarism, since quotations (other people’s words) are clearly distinguished from discussion (your words). Be sure to identify quotations in the “Evidence” column with page numbers. Although your “Evidence” column might include many useful quotations, you don’t need to include them all, word-for-word, in your final essay. You can write paraphrases and summaries or simply insert page numbers. (See Chapter 10’s “Integrate Sources Effectively,” p. 000.)

Gather material from your notes as well as from the text. Reread the text and your notes with your argument in mind, building support for your thesis.

The following example of an argument matrix is taken from an essay in progress on Nicholas Carr’s “Is Google Making Us Stupid?” (p. 000).

Working thesis: that reading has changed further since e-book readers and tablets like the iPad and the Kindle were introduced.

CLAIMS
Carr was unable to foresee devices that make reading long texts easy and pleasant.

EVIDENCE
Carr’s article appeared in 2008. The Kindle was introduced just a year earlier and hadn’t yet had much impact, as it sold out quickly and was unavailable for several months after that. The iPad wasn’t introduced until 2010.

DISCUSSION
The only e-readers Carr would have known about were pretty primitive by today’s standards and couldn’t offer a reading experience that compared to the reading of books.


#### Guidelines: Making a Three-Column Document

To make a three-column document in Microsoft Word, follow these steps.

- Open a new document and choose “Table” under the “Insert” menu. A dialog box will pop up. (On a Mac, choose “Insert” under the “Table” menu.)

- In the “Number of columns” text box, type “3.”

- In the “Number of rows” text box, type “2.” Click “Okay” and a table will appear in the document.

- In the top row, type “Claims” in the left-hand column, type “Evidence” in the middle column, and type “Discussion” in the right-hand column. If you wish, select each of these words and click on the icon for centered text and the icon for boldface. Your first entry will begin in the second row.

- You can add rows as needed: under the “Table” menu, choose “Insert” and then choose “Rows Below” on the submenu that appears.

CLAIMS
Technology has become our means for obtaining and reading books.
The Internet may be “remapping the neural circuitry” once again, in ways that Carr would appreciate — thus helping us to be immersed in texts, rather than the opposite.
The medium, whether paper or screen, does affect our reading experience, but not necessarily for the worse.

EVIDENCE
12.8 million e-readers were purchased in 2010, and as of October 2014, Apple has reportedly sold 170 million iPads (though it’s impossible to know how many are used as e-readers).

Carr explains that our brains — “our neural circuitry”—are changed by our activities: we can gain a skill by practicing it, or lose it by not practicing it.

Carr writes as if computers can only really be used for surfing of some kind. But we don’t just surf on our computers: we read.
E-readers and tablets are lightweight, can be held at any angle, and can be carried anywhere. They usually have an integrated dictionary, making it easy to look up words. Print size can be adjusted. E-readers like the Kindle often have anti-glare screens that resemble paper. You can easily search for a word or phrase.

DISCUSSION
It’s very difficult to find reliable numbers for how many people read whole books on e-readers and tablets.
I think this brain-changing must work both ways:
just as our brains adapt to surfing if computers encourage it, they can adapt to reading again if devices encourage that instead. (Maybe discuss the amazing skills of some gamers? See McGonigal.)
Carr writes that, “thanks to the ubiquity of text on the Internet,” we may be reading more, but
“it’s a different kind of reading, and behind it lies a different kind of thinking — perhaps even a new sense of the self” (p. 000). I’m not sure this is so true any more.

CLAIMS
Technology keeps changing, and recent developments might alleviate some of Carr’s concerns.

EVIDENCE
As Carr himself acknowledges, humans are changed forever by each new technology, whether it’s the invention of writing, the printing press, the Internet, or e-readers. (p. 000)

DISCUSSION
There’s always going to be loss as well as gain. But reading long texts seems to be making a comeback.
Anticipating and Incorporating Counterarguments 127

### Anticipating and Incorporating Counterarguments
The “Claims” column is also the place to list counterarguments and your rebuttals. A counterargument is an argument that opposes your own argument. Why bring counterarguments into your essay? For two reasons: First, an intelligent reader may well be thinking already of objections to your argument, and you can put these opposing ideas to rest by preemptively responding to them. Second, by addressing counterarguments, you show that you have thoroughly considered every aspect of your argument and are hiding nothing. Anticipating and refuting counterarguments makes your own argument stronger.

Counterarguments are often addressed near the end of an essay, after the main argument has been presented, but they may be included almost anywhere. They may be introduced with phrases such as “although some might argue . . .” or “some readers might object to this argument, saying . . .” No argument should ignore potential counterarguments. At the very least, take some time during this phase of the writing process to play the role of a skeptical reader and imagine how such a reader might challenge the argument you are making. Experienced academic writers learn to play this role constantly as they work, continually seeking out the weaknesses and limitations of their own arguments and figuring out reasonable responses as they put together their claims and support.
You may think of a counterargument that you simply cannot rebut. This is no disaster: it might indicate that your thesis needs to be rethought or qualified — and at this early stage in the process, it certainly can be. If you’ve drafted a working  thesis with the assumption that you’ll revise it anyway, you will be less reluctant to shift direction. Often, however, an irrefutable counterargument is not so strong that it requires a total revision of the thesis; it just means that one or more unanswered questions remain. In such a case, don’t suppress the question: acknowledge it, and show how it might suggest a direction for further research.

### Developing Arguments
This activity provides an opportunity to practice developing arguments.
Step 1. Choose one of the propositions from the list below and work out an argument for it, based on your own experience, beliefs, and general knowledge. (If time allows, you may choose to conduct research in the library or on the Internet, but research is not required.) As you develop arguments, write out your claims in full sentences, and spell out the support for each claim as fully as you can. Use a three-column argument matrix (p. 000).
Step 2. Trade your work with a classmate. Examine your classmate’s argument carefully. Look for places where, in your estimation, your classmate has presented the arguments fully and persuasively, as well as places where the argument needs more development.
Step 3. Look over your classmate’s comments on your own work. How might you strengthen your argument by explicating the ideas more fully? With your classmate’s help, develop and strengthen your original argument.
Step 4. Work out counterarguments and then address them. Identify two or three unanswered questions or problems that remain.

- Video games do [or do not] have real educational value.
- Americans are [or are not] becoming too materialistic.
- Smoking tobacco should [or should not] be illegal.
- Taxpayer dollars, through government grants, should [or should not] be used to support the arts.
- Physical education classes, three times a week, should [or should not] be a required element in the curriculum throughout grade school, middle school, and
high school.
- The United States should [or should not] dismantle all its nuclear weapons, unilaterally.
- Gay men and women should [or should not] have the right to legal marriage in all fifty states.
- Owners of SUVs should [or should not] have to pay a special “gas guzzler” tax.

In your argument matrix, identify counterclaims clearly as such in the left-hand column. Your discussion notes for each counterclaim should be a refutation of the claim.

### Drafting Paragraphs
Now that you have some claims, evidence, and discussion, you are ready to begin drafting paragraphs. Think of each major paragraph in the body of your essay as making a little argument of its own, beginning with a claim and developing the evidence and discussion that support the claim. (The introductory paragraph works a little differently, as it normally serves to present the purpose of your essay and your thesis statement.) The final shape, number, and arrangement of these paragraphs will change as your work progresses, but it’s helpful to put together at least three or four paragraphs as soon as you can so that you have a skeletal structure to build on.

### Drafting Introductory Paragraphs
In an argument essay, the introductory paragraph (or paragraphs) serves chiefly to introduce the reader to the essay’s purpose. In general, the purpose of an argument essay should be clear by the second or third paragraph. Few readers have the patience to read much further without a sense of where the essay is going.

The introductory paragraph needs to do more than just present the thesis. As we noted, a good thesis offers the solution to a problem, the answer to a question, or a stand on an issue. Moreover, the writer must demonstrate that the problem is real and, if it’s not obvious, that it matters because it produces some sort of error or cost. This is the argument’s motive. Explaining the motive could require several paragraphs, so your solution — your thesis statement — might not appear until the second, third, or even fourth paragraph. However, in an argument essay, it is usually wise to present the thesis promptly once the motive is clear; delaying it may lead the reader to wonder whether you have anything to contribute.

Consider the following example of how an argument’s motive might be presented. The bare thesis statement in this case is “the federal government must develop a more complex method of calculating wealth, one that accounts for local differences in the cost of living.” In itself, this doesn’t mean much. But an introductory phrase (shown underlined) can be added that positions it as the solution to a problem.

In order to obtain an accurate count of the number of Americans who live in poverty, the federal government must develop a more complex method of calculating wealth, one that accounts for local differences in the cost of living.

The problem is that government researchers lack an accurate count of the number of Americans who live in poverty. Adding the introductory phrase is an improvement over the bare thesis, of course, because the phrase explains why the government should develop better methods of calculating wealth. But it still doesn’t explain why solving this particular problem is important. An additional sentence (shown underlined) following the thesis can help.

In order to obtain an accurate count of the number of Americans who live in poverty, the federal government must develop a more complex method of calculating wealth, one that accounts for local differences in the cost of living. Only when more precise estimates of the number of Americans in need of federal help become available will it become possible to spend taxpayers’ money wisely and effectively.

This more complete account of the problem shows that it also entails a cost and that the solution confers a benefit. In this case, providing this information can be done simply by indicating that without an accurate count of the number of Americans living in poverty, it’s impossible to spend taxpayers’ money wisely and effectively. For some arguments, though, you’ll need to write more than one or two sentences: if the problem, its costs, and the solution’s benefits are not obvious, and if they require a paragraph or more of explanation, be prepared to supply it.

In certain situations, you might need to go even further and relate the narrower problem explicitly to the broader work of the discipline as a whole. Again, the example is underlined.

In order to obtain an accurate count of the number of Americans who live in poverty, the federal government must develop a more complex method of calculating wealth, one that accounts for local differences in the cost of living. Only when more precise estimates of the number of Americans in need of federal help become available will it become possible to spend taxpayers’ money wisely and effectively. Economists have suggested several alternatives to the method currently in use, but so far none have been considered politically acceptable.

#### :notebook_with_decorative_cover: Examining the Problem and Solution
Examine Emily Esfahani Smith’s “Life on the Island” (p. 000) carefully, looking for statements that discuss the problem she is addressing. Is it a practical problem or a knowledge problem? What does she suggest, explicitly or implicitly, about the cost or costs of the problem? What solution does she propose, and what is its value or benefit?

Whether such additional detail is needed depends on the audience and the assignment. In an essay for an economics course, for example, such a statement might not be necessary because any professional economist could be expected to know this; thus you can leave some aspects of the motive unstated and implied. If you are confident that the reader shares your concern with the problem under discussion, you might not need to provide an explicit link between the problem and the aims of the discipline as a whole.

Argument essays sometimes begin with a story or description of a representative case that paints a vivid picture of the problem. A paragraph or two of this kind of narrative can be especially effective because readers will almost always read to the end of a story, simply to find out how it ends.

### Drafting Body Paragraphs
When writing a first draft, we tend to leave the claim until late in the paragraph, perhaps even the last sentence, because we develop clarity about what we want to say only gradually, through the process of writing it out. We will begin with some detail that stands out for us, make connections to other details, figure out how it all adds up, and finally state what it means for the main argument as a way of wrapping up. Then we move on to a new paragraph.
Ed: x-ref to msp. 566

Such a process is quite normal in the early writerly stages. But a paragraph organized in this way makes heavy demands on readers, because it reveals the actual point so very late. Readers must hold a mass of perplexing details in their heads for several sentences—until finally at the end of the paragraph the point becomes clear. Some readers may get annoyed; some may lose patience and stop reading altogether.

As you draft the body paragraphs of your essay, bear in mind that the first sentence sets the direction. If the reader gets a clear sense of a paragraph’s theme from the first sentence, and if the rest of the paragraph keeps to the theme, even as it develops and elaborates it, then your reader will feel that the paragraph has unity.

Readers need to find a topic sentence—a sentence that declares the paragraph’s main concern, theme, or point — at the beginning of the paragraph so that they understand its purpose from the outset and do not have to puzzle through information that lacks any clear purpose. In fact, this need to find the paragraph’s main point is so powerful that the first sentence tends to function as the paragraph’s topic sentence whether it is meant to or not. So, since your reader will assume that your first sentence signals the topic of the whole paragraph, your task is to make sure that it does so as clearly and precisely as possible.

However, an argument essay is not composed of a series of topics. As we’ve seen, an argument is made up of claims and support for those claims. So in an argument essay, the purpose of most paragraphs will be to present a claim and to support it. The claim really governs the paragraph, as everything else in the paragraph should support it. At least initially, placing your claim in the first sentence is a safe strategy: your point will be clear from the outset.

You can then develop the support for this claim in the rest of the paragraph. Present it fully, laying out the evidence and explaining in detail how the evidence supports the claim. As writers, we tend to assume that readers will understand how a piece of evidence supports a claim—for us, it’s perfectly obvious—but to any reader who is new to your ideas or has a different point of view, the relation may not be obvious at all. Spell it out. Evidence — whether it’s data, a quotation, or an observation — rarely speaks for itself; it almost always needs to be explained. The “Discussion” column in your argument matrix should give you some words and phrases to begin developing this explanation.

If the point you want to make is complicated and the paragraph must be long, you can strengthen the paragraph’s unity by incorporating words or phrases into later sentences that link back to the main topic or theme, thereby showing how these sentences relate to it. Repeating the exact same word frequently will create a sense of tedium, but words and phrases that are related but not identical, that work as variations on a theme, can forge connections and develop your point at the same time.

Here is a paragraph from Nicholas Carr’s “Is Google Making Us Stupid?” (p. 000). The first word, “Reading,” lets the reader know the paragraph’s main theme. Earlier in the essay, Carr discusses the effect of the Internet on brain function, and in the paragraph just before this one he introduces the idea that the Internet may be eroding our ability to read. Here he explains how different ways of reading require different neural circuits. We will examine this paragraph more closely later in this chapter (p. 000), but for now, notice how variations on the theme of reading help tie the paragraph together.

Reading, explains Wolf, is not an instinctive skill for human beings. It’s not etched into our genes the way speech is. We have to teach our minds how to translate the symbolic characters we see into the language we understand. And the media or other technologies we use in learning and practicing the craft of reading play an important part in shaping the neural circuits inside our brains. Experiments demonstrate that readers of ideograms, such as the Chinese, develop a mental circuitry for reading that is very different from the circuitry found in those of us whose written language employs an alphabet. The variations extend across many regions of the brain, including those that govern such essential cognitive functions as memory and the interpretation of visual and auditory stimuli. We can expect as well that the circuits woven by our use of the Net will be different from those woven by our reading of books and other printed works. (p. 000)

## Drafting Concluding Paragraphs
At this stage, a concluding paragraph is not really necessary; you can leave it for the revision stage, when your argument is already solid enough that you can step back and reflect on it. At this point, it’s enough to say that a conclusion should not repeat points that you have already made clear. Rather than closing off the essay, the conclusion should really open it up, giving the reader a sense of its importance and its broader implications or suggesting directions for further research or questions that remain unanswered. The conclusion should give the reader something to think about, a send-off rather than a wrap-up.

Perhaps owing to the pressure of deadlines, some student writers revise their writing only slightly before submitting it. But failing to revise—or failing to allow enough time to revise — is to miss the opportunity for thinking and learning that writing assignments offer, and almost certainly it means submitting work that misrepresents your real abilities.
Revising is not the same as editing or proofreading. The word “revise” — from the Latin revisere, “to look at again”—means to see your work again. When you revise, you don’t just clean up your writing or correct it; you step back from it, identify its strengths and weaknesses, and then do whatever’s necessary to improve it — cut, add, rewrite, rearrange, rethink, even start again.
In a sense, writing is revision. You began your work with notes in the margins of a text as you read and reread; you developed some of these impressions into phrases and sentences in a notebook; you further developed some of these ideas in your informal, writerly explorations. Finally, as an argument emerged, you began to focus on a thesis, and you developed some paragraphs for a first draft of your essay. At every stage, you revised—reconsidered, selected, expanded, developed—some sort of writing that already existed. (You could even call your first reading of a text a kind of revision—a “re-seeing” of the author’s point of view by bringing your own point of view to bear on it.) Selecting, rethinking, and rewriting have been essential to the process.

Susan Sontag, one of America’s most highly regarded essayists, remarked:
>I don’t write easily or rapidly. My first draft usually has only a few elements worth keeping. I have to find out what those are and build from them and throw out what doesn’t work, or what is simply not alive. So there is a process of rewriting, of accumulation. [^2]

Although her published essays seem spontaneous and confident, Sontag suggests that a great part of her work involves discerning what’s worth keeping and what must be cut. We naturally become attached to passages that took a lot of time and effort, and it takes backbone to cut such passages. But cut we must. A careful reader (perhaps a fellow student, a tutor, or a professor) can help identify what should be kept and what needs to go. (Most writers rely on such readers at some stage in the writing process.) But an awareness of what to keep and what to cut also comes from a growing sense of the whole argument that emerges during the revision process.

[^2]:  Charles Ruas, *Conversations with American Writers* (New York: Knopf, 1985), 186.

Rethinking, rewriting, cutting, and rearranging are essential elements in the writing process. They’re the way that a writer moves from a messy, informal draft that was never meant to be read by someone else to a clear, persuasive, eloquent, and pleasing final product. Thus, even when we feel ready to move to the next stage in the writing process, we frequently find ourselves circling back to an earlier stage. Perhaps we need to reread a passage and take more notes in order to improve a paragraph that analyzes the text. Or we need to do some more informal writing so that we can figure out more clearly how a certain part of our argument works (it hadn’t seemed so important at first, but now it’s obviously crucial). And we’ll have to revise our thesis statement to reflect this change, and maybe write two more paragraphs to explain it, and so on. So we need to modify our workflow diagram: writers don’t move steadily from one phase of the writing process to the next, without ever looking back — they keep circling back through the phases until they get it right. The process looks more like the diagram below — though even this may be an oversimplification, as any phase can lead back to any other phase at any point.

Figure 5.2 Workflow Revision

The process of developing an argument is recursive because an argument evolves as its elements become clearer — as claims and support become articulated in full sentences, as the relation between claims and support and between the various claims themselves begins to emerge distinctly on the page. And as the argument emerges, it becomes possible to shape the thesis statement into a more perfect expression of the argument’s central idea. Perfecting the thesis statement, in turn, makes it possible to refine the argument with greater clarity and confidence. A strong argument emerges only by cycling through the process several times. In essence, you must constantly move between the argument in progress and the evidence in order to check, refine, and strengthen your argument.
Inexperienced writers, especially when under the pressure of a deadline, sometimes write out a thesis statement in a first draft and never bother to go back and revise or sharpen it. The result is usually disappointing: either the actual argument doesn’t fit the thesis statement very well, in which case the reader can only be confused about the essay’s purpose, or the argument gets molded to fit the thesis, no matter what the facts actually show, in which case the reader can only be left feeling unconvinced. But ideas evolve as the writing happens, and both the thesis and the argument must evolve together, with each continually adapting to the changing shape of the other, a process that may be described as “dialectical.”

A dialectic, as we said in Chapter 2, is a thinking method that moves forward by means of two or more elements that test and correct each other. Often this involves a process of exposing and correcting errors or flaws. This dialectical process of refining a working thesis as an argument evolves resembles the method of empirical science known as the “data-model loop” (see Figure 5.1). Laboratory scientists start with a model or prediction of an experiment’s outcome. Next, they devise an experiment that will test this theory as conclusively as possible. Typically, the results of the experiment — the data — reveal how the initial model needs to be corrected or revised, and this new model will then be tested by further experimentation. By this recursive process of theorizing and testing, science gets steadily closer to the truth, and advances are made. Thus the loop is really a spiral that steadily advances upward, since the cycle doesn’t return to the same point; each refinement in the model represents an advance in knowledge.

Writers rarely formulate a perfect thesis statement before the argument is fully formed because they seldom have a crystal-clear sense of the entire argument when they first sit down to write. Clarity emerges through the activity of writing and rewriting. A working thesis and an evolving argument have a dialectical relation: as the argument emerges more clearly, it requires corrections in the working thesis, but a clearer and more precise thesis also makes a stronger argument possible. As you develop your argument, expect to revise your thesis several times as your ideas become clearer through the writing process.

### Limiting Your Thesis
Earlier in this chapter (p. 000), we identified two criteria for a good thesis: it is fresh, insightful, and interesting; and it can be supported with evidence and strong reasoning. The second of these criteria means that the scope of the thesis must be appropriate for the assignment. That is, if the thesis is making a claim that’s too broad to argue within the assignment’s page limit, you don’t have much hope of persuading your reader. For professional researchers, it makes sense to limit the scope of the problem they are working on; the more limited the scope, the better the chances of solving the problem and making a genuine contribution. Likewise, you should narrow your thesis to make it more manageable. Student essays are usually between five and twenty pages. If your thesis is too broad or too ambitious, you won’t be able to support it in such a confined space. So it usually helps to limit your thesis, narrowing it down to a specific proposition that you can adequately treat in the pages you have available.

One of the chief functions of a thesis statement is to fence off the territory of your argument, so it needs to define, or draw limits around, your main idea. A thesis statement needs to give both a complete and precise synopsis of your argument. As you revise your working thesis statement, look for words and phrases that will sharpen it and indicate its limits. Consider the following examples:

- Too broad: There are ideas in Rousseau’s The Social Contract that can be applied to today’s world.
- Appropriate: Rousseau’s analysis of democracy, with its four essential components (a “small state,” “simplicity of manners,” “large measure of equality,” “little or no luxury” [bk. III, ch. 4, p. 113]), can help resolve the political crisis of our time as more Americans lose faith in the workings of a democratically elected government.
(Student writer Ben Dauksewicz)

- Too broad: President Franklin Pierce signed the Kansas-Nebraska Act because he thought it was the best thing for the country
- Appropriate: Although a supporter of states’ rights and the Missouri Compromise, President Franklin Pierce signed the Kansas-Nebraska Act into law because he believed that the advantages of a transcontinental railroad were worth the political price: the potential benefits to the country outweighed the anger that the repeal of the Compromise would surely provoke.
(Student writer Zach Peikon) 

- Too broad: The minimum wage should be increased.
- Appropriate: The minimum wage should be raised to a level at which workers can cope with the rising cost of living in each state as determined by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which “is a measure of the overall cost of the goods and services bought by a typical consumer.” Each of the fifty states should be required by a federal mandate to have their own minimum wage based on the average cost of living in each respective state. (Student writer Tao Lin Pao)

## Revising: A Recursive Process

### Hedging
Some argument essays are polemic ( from the Greek word polemos, meaning “war”): their purpose is to defeat a real or imagined opponent, so they state their claims as strongly as possible. But defeating an opponent is rarely the purpose of academic writing; rather, the goal is to get as close to the truth as possible. As a result, academic writers are typically cautious, and they often qualify their claims with words or phrases such as “probably,” “perhaps,” “possibly,” “may,” “might,” “in most cases,” or “could be considered.” These are called hedge words. Their purpose is not to weaken the argument or to make it wishy-washy. Rather, such words enable writers to convey their degree of certainty. If you present an idea as a possibility rather than a certainty, readers will take you no less seriously; indeed, when you refuse to overstate your claims, you are more likely to be received as a careful and responsible thinker.

But “hedging” is not merely a matter of using qualifiers. It is also a matter of providing an accurate assessment of the strength of the evidence, not only in the thesis statement but throughout the essay. In the following passage, the animal scientist Temple Grandin argues that certain dog breeds are more aggressive than others. Notice how she carefully hedges her claim — not just with hedge words and phrases, but with a frank account of the evidence that makes it impossible to offer more than an educated guess about this matter.

>The genetics of aggression is an especially thorny issue with dogs. Most people don’t want to believe that there are some breeds, like pit bulls and Rottweilers, that are more aggressive by nature. (Pit bulls aren’t an established AKC [American Kennel Club] breed.) Usually these folks have known or owned individual Rotties or pits who were sweet and good-natured, so they conclude that when a Rottweiler or a pit bull shows aggression the problem is the owner not the dog. But the statistics don’t support this interpretation, although it’s true that statistics on dog bites aren’t hard and fast.

>There are lots of problems with dog bite reports. For one thing, there are a few different kinds of dogs that are called pit bulls, including some purebreds like the American Staffordshire terrier and some mixed-breed dogs. Another problem: large dogs do more damage when they bite people, so they’re probably over-represented in the statistics. Also, lots of purebred owners fail to register their dogs with the AKC, so it’s impossible to know exactly how many purebred Rottweilers there are in the country and compare that figure to the number of reported dog bites committed by Rottweilers.

>Because dog population data is imprecise, no one can nail down exactly what each breed’s “aggression quotient” is compared to other breeds. Still, you can get an overall picture of which breeds are most dangerous by looking at medical reports of dog bites. On average, Rottweilers and pit bulls are so much more aggressive than other breeds that it’s extremely unlikely bad owners alone could account for the higher rate of biting. And if you’re looking only at anecdotal evidence, there are plenty of cases of nice, competent owners with vicious Rottweilers or pit bulls. Aggression isn’t always the owner’s fault. Writing about pit bulls, Nick Dodman says,
>>“Originally bred for aggression and tenacity, pit bulls, if provoked, will bite hard and hang on, making them as potentially dangerous as a handgun without a safety lock. . . . [T]hey can become quite civilized, developing into loyal and entertaining companions. But the potential for trouble is always lurking somewhere, as a result of their genes and breeding.” [^3]

Grandin is speculating here, but speculation is perfectly valid as long as it is presented as speculation, and not as near certainty. The purpose of the hedging in this passage is to establish a just relation between the nature of the evidence and the strength of the claim. This hedging is an important part of what it means to be a responsible writer: to overstate or understate, whether deliberately or carelessly, is to engage in a kind of deception, and in academic writing especially, such deception is to be scrupulously avoided.

### Revising Paragraphs
When we discussed drafting body paragraphs, we said that the first sentence sets the paragraph’s direction and that normally body paragraphs should open with a claim, followed by the supporting evidence and reasoning. But not every paragraph has to be structured in exactly the same way; in fact, some variety helps prevent monotony and lets you accommodate exceptional situations (for example, paragraphs that tell a story or raise a question rather than make an argument).

Now that you have drafted a few paragraphs, we can complicate things a bit and distinguish three separate functions that the opening of a paragraph should fulfill: transition, topic, and claim. Recognizing these three functions makes it possible to try different ways of structuring paragraphs while still keeping the argument clear and strong.

[^3]: Temple Grandin and Catherine Johnson, Animals in Translation: Using the Mysteries of Autism to Decode Animal Behavior (New York: Harcourt/Harvest, 2006), 148–49.

#### Transition

A transition guides the reader from the previous topic to the topic of the new paragraph. Transitions can be a word (“moreover,” “however,” “furthermore,” “nevertheless”), a phrase (“in contrast,” “in addition,” “for example”), or a whole sentence (“Now that we have considered the historical record, let’s look at the situation in America today”). Of course, transitions can be used between sentences and clauses as well, but they are often especially helpful when the reader moves from one unit of the argument to a new one—which typically involves moving from one paragraph to another. Transitions give the reader a sense of the relation between this new paragraph and the previous one, whether it be one of contrast, addition, or something else. Avoid using transition words and phrases mechanically or thoughtlessly. A transition is not always necessary, but it is often helpful. Think like a reader and use your best judgment. As a rule, make your transitions no longer than necessary; you want to keep the argument moving.

#### Topic

As we suggested earlier, a topic and a claim are not the same thing. The topic is the general subject of a paragraph, while the claim is the point you want to make, the paragraph’s real purpose. The first sentence of the paragraph must give readers a clear sense of the topic; this opening sentence is the chief means by which a paragraph coheres. But as long as the topic is clear, the claim can be moved elsewhere in the paragraph.

#### Claim

While placing the claim in the first sentence generally works well, it is not absolutely necessary. As long as the paragraph’s first sentence clearly states the topic, the claim can appear later in the paragraph. It can appear in the second sentence or at the end of the paragraph — both prominent positions. Occasionally, the claim might appear elsewhere. Moreover, the claim can be split between two sentences. For example, it might be stated in general terms at the beginning of the paragraph (to make the main point clear) and in more precise terms later on. Or it can be stated in part early in the paragraph and in part later on.

The main thing to avoid is burying the claim in other material, where it might be overlooked.

In a longer essay, variations in paragraph structure help prevent monotony and predictability. But if there’s any possibility of confusion, remember that the point of the paragraph is usually clearest if the claim appears early. To sum up:
- The topic must occur in the first sentence.
- The claim may occur in the first, the second, or even the last sentence.
- The claim may be split between two sentences.
It is useful to recall these structural principles as you revise a thesis-driven essay because when you draft ideas, there is a natural tendency to begin a paragraph with evidence and end it with a claim. This occurs because we gain clarity as we write: usually we need to work through the evidence before we can be sure what our claim is — that is, what claim is truly justified by the evidence and what words best express our claim. Therefore, to work well as readerly arguments, writerly drafts often need to be reorganized: the thesis has to be moved from the last paragraph to the first, perhaps, and claims need to be repositioned at the beginning of paragraphs instead of the end.

### Strengthening Paragraph Cohesion

The first requirement of revision is to shift perspective and think like a reader. There are two ways of looking at a paragraph: a bird’s-eye view and a globe-trotter’s view. As writers we can take the bird’s-eye view, looking, as if from above, at the whole paragraph spread out like a map — the topic sentence at the top, supporting material beneath, perhaps a closing sentence at the bottom. But readers do not experience paragraphs this way. They’re more like hikers moving through a landscape, or sailors navigating a sea dotted with islands. They encounter one sentence at a time and must work to make sense of each in relation to previous sentences and paragraphs. They don’t know what lurks over the horizon, and the horizon changes constantly as they move through the text. A bird’s-eye view can be helpful when we position the main elements of a paragraph — topic, claim, support — but we need to imagine the globe-trotter’s view to make the paragraph fully clear and coherent.

As we discussed earlier in “Drafting Body Paragraphs” (p. 000), revising a paragraph often means locating the claim and moving it to the beginning of the paragraph. But shaping a paragraph into a coherent unit within your argument may require a little more work. To start with, a draft paragraph that is trying to make more than one claim and address more than one topic may need to be split into two or even three paragraphs. But even after you’ve revised a paragraph so that it focuses on a single important claim and has unity, you may still be able to strengthen its cohesion, the way it feels like it holds together for the reader.

Let’s look again at that paragraph about reading from Nicholas Carr’s “Is Google Making Us Stupid?” (p. 000). We observed earlier that the focus of the paragraph is “reading,” and Carr uses variations of that term and related terms to keep this focus in the foreground throughout (“translate the symbolic characters,” “the craft of reading,” “readers of ideograms,” “reading of books,” and so on). But there’s another theme at work in the paragraph, which we might call “brain functioning.” In the copy below, terms related to this theme are underlined.

>Reading, explains Wolf, is not an instinctive skill for human beings. It’s not etched into our genes the way speech is. We have to teach our minds how to translate the symbolic characters we see into the language we understand. And the media or other technologies we use in learning and practicing the craft of reading play an important part in shaping the neural circuits inside our brains. Experiments demonstrate that readers of ideograms, such as the Chinese, develop a mental circuitry for reading that is very different from the circuitry found in those of us whose written language employs an alphabet. The variations extend across many regions of the brain, including those that govern such essential cognitive functions as memory and the interpretation of visual and auditory stimuli. We can expect as well that the circuits woven by our use of the Net will be different from those woven by our reading of books and other printed works. (p. 000)

While brain functioning is a theme here, along with reading, it is not a new theme in the way that reading is. Carr has discussed reading before in the essay, but never in such a detailed, focused way. Brain functioning, however, has been a theme from the outset, so we could call it a “given” theme rather than a new one, since the reader is already familiar with it. Most paragraphs work this way: there’s a given theme, one that has already appeared, and a new theme, one that gives a particular paragraph its special purpose. The writer needs to show the reader how the new relates to the given, and it helps if this connection is made early in the paragraph. Here, Carr makes the connection in the third sentence, but the first two sentences are short, so the reader can manage. And each sentence that follows contains terms that make a clear connection between the new and the given. This repetition of the given theme also helps the reader understand Carr’s point about the complicated and varied ways in which the brain processes writing. The repetition of terms relating to the new theme and of terms related to the given theme helps to give the paragraph cohesion and a clear sense of purpose.

### Varying Paragraph Length

Paragraphs are sometimes described as the building blocks of the essay. The word “block” suggests unity and cohesion, qualities that paragraphs do need to have. But building blocks are usually alike in shape and size, and the analogy suggests a sameness that could lead to a plodding, repetitive structure. The architectural metaphor we introduced in the opening of this chapter, that of rooms in a well-planned home, might be more useful. Each room is distinct — kitchen, living room, dining room, bedrooms — and each serves a particular purpose. And ideally each room has been designed and furnished to be both functional and pleasing.

If you were to tour such a home, you’d find transitions between rooms — doors and hallways that connect them — and each room would fulfill a particular function. Paragraphs work rather like rooms: each should have its own purpose, but each should contribute to the whole. While paragraphs should cohere, they can be almost any length (though probably not much more than a page); they need not be uniform. A paragraph break marks a pause and gives readers a sense of where one unit of the argument ends and another begins. Since readers usually see the length of a paragraph (perhaps unconsciously, out of the corner of their eyes) before they read any actual words, they know whether to brace themselves for a long trek or whether to relax a little. You can experiment with paragraph breaks, creating shorter or longer paragraphs to suit your argument’s needs.

In modern academic writing, paragraphs are usually less than a page in length. It’s rare, however, to find many short paragraphs (of, say, less than four lines) in a row. A typical paragraph would be roughly ten to twenty lines in length. But there will be variety. Short paragraphs are sometimes needed; for example, a brief transitional paragraph might sum up all that’s been established so far and hint at where the argument will go next.

And sometimes short paragraphs can simply underscore a point.

### Concluding Paragraphs
In the body of the essay, you’ve been taking your reader through a forest of details. But by the conclusion, it may have become difficult, as the saying goes, to see the forest for the trees. Here, you may need to speak to the reader about the forest, the big picture: why all this matters and what it means. As we said earlier, a concluding paragraph should never be redundant and should never merely restate an argument that should already have been made clear. Instead, it should offer summation, not summary—a more distant perspective, not repetition. A good conclusion answers the question “So what?” or “What now?” or “Where do we go from here?” or “What else must we consider in connection with this problem?”

So while the concluding paragraph brings the essay to a close, the closure need not be airtight. The most effective closings resonate, leaving the reader with something to think about. The concluding paragraph is often the place to point out questions that remain unanswered or to suggest directions for further research. (You might choose to end the essay with a question.) In this sense, the conclusion is less an ending than a send-off: you are passing the baton to the reader now, to go out and act or reflect or investigate further, as the case may be.

If the rest of the essay has done its job and made a strong case for your thesis, then you might choose to close with a gentle tug at the reader’s heartstrings, especially if you feel that action or assent is urgently needed. Earlier in this chapter, we discussed Aristotle’s concepts of logos, ethos, and pathos and noted that in an academic essay pathos—an appeal to the emotions—typically takes a backseat to logos — an appeal to reason. But the concluding paragraph can be the right place for a little pathos. For example, if your opening paragraph describes a problem and its costs, your concluding paragraph might return to the subject of these costs, reminding the reader of the reasons that it is important to address the problem as soon as possible.

### Checklist for Developing an Argument

Keep the following in mind as you develop your argument.

<input type="checkbox" name="argument">The argument<label for="argument"> </label>
- The argument needs to have a motive. It should respond to a need, such as a
problem, a question, or an issue.
- The argument must make a claim. It needs to offer a solution, suggest an answer, or take a stand.
- The argument has to support its claim(s) with evidence and reasoning that are both valid and relevant. The type of evidence should be appropriate for the particular assignment.

<input type="checkbox" name="thesis">The thesis statement<label for="thesis"> </label>
- The thesis statement functions as the “master claim” of the essay.
- It should be fresh, insightful, and interesting.
- It can be supported with evidence and reasoning.
- It may be revised as your argument develops. You can limit and “hedge”the thesis statement as necessary.

<input type="checkbox" name="paragraphs">Paragraphs<label for="paragraphs"> </label>
- The introductory paragraph(s) should present the essay’s motive and thesis.
- Each body paragraph should usually begin with a claim; support for the claim should fill out the rest of the paragraph. However, if the first sentence makes the topic of the paragraph clear, you can position the claim elsewhere in the paragraph. But avoid burying the claim in a place where it might be overlooked.
- Where necessary, begin paragraphs with transition words, phrases, or sentences. Think like a reader!
- Address counterarguments in one or more paragraphs.
- Vary the length of paragraphs.
- The concluding paragraph should offer a “send-off.”
