# Writing to Discover and Develop Ideas

## The Value of Exploratory Writing

>“The formulation of a problem is often more essential than its solution, which may be merely a matter of mathematical or experimental skill. To raise new questions, new possibilities, to regard old problems from a new angle, requires creative imagination and marks real advance in science.” Albert Einstein

Writing is often a mysterious business. Some days, we sit down at our desks, and the words just tumble out; ideas delight and surprise us as they parade acrossthe page. It all seems fun and stress-free, hardly like work at all. Yet the next day, for some reason, words refuse to cooperate, and nothing we write seems the least bit interesting or worthwhile. We get distracted, take a coffee break, watch YouTube, return to our work. But it’s as if the words we need are bottled up in some hidden recess of the brain, and we just can’t seem to get them out. At those times, writing can be brutally hard work, like carving granite with a teaspoon.
 
It’s just as hard to account for the enormous differences in how writers experience the creative process. Some write slowly and with difficulty, others quickly and easily; some keep to a strict routine, others change their methods frequently — yet many different working styles can be equally productive in the end. Each writer must learn through experience how to get his or her best work done, and many aspects of the whole complicated business — how the mind finds words, how words give form to ideas, how one idea leads to another — may never be fully understood.

But even though these mysteries lie at the heart of the writing process, most experienced writers agree on certain productivity strategies. First, the writing process is typically recursive: it loops back through the phases of the process as many times as necessary. So reading leads to note-taking, note-taking leads back to reading, further note-taking leads to drafting, then some difficulty arises that leads back to additional reading, and so on. (We’ll return to this theme in Chapter 5.) Second, experienced writers tend to agree on the importance of separating out two distinct phases of the writing process: informal writing to discover and develop ideas, and revising and editing this writing to make those ideas clear to the reader.

We’re all tempted to believe that we can hammer out good writing in one sitting, simply pouring out our brilliance onto a computer screen. Oh, a bit of editing and polishing might be necessary afterward, but (we tell ourselves) it ought to be possible to express ideas directly and clearly (shouldn’t it?), as we do routinely when we speak.
In reality, however, that’s not how writing works.

Here’s the problem: if we approach the first draft as if it were the final version, we require ourselves to do two conflicting things at the same time: we must figure out our ideas for ourselves and at the same time we must make sense of these ideas for the reader. To do both at the same time is not exactly impossible—we manage it with simple pieces of writing like text messages and short e-mails, and some of us could even cobble together something resembling an essay this way — but it is certainly inadvisable. It’s inadvisable because college-level writing must possess qualities that few of us can achieve all at once on the first pass: preciseness, nuance, clarity, complexity, and logical rigor. We will write a better essay, and the work will go more smoothly, if we separate out the informal exploratory writing from the formal essay writing. When the writing process does clog up and break down, it’s usually because we are trying to do both the writerly and the readerly at the same time.

## The Writerly versus the Readerly
When writing informally to discover and develop ideas, you are working toward meeting your own need to develop and clarify your thoughts. When rewriting, revising, and editing, you are working toward meeting your reader’s need to understand and appreciate your ideas. Writers sometimes refer to the first kind of writing as writerly and the second as readerly,[^1] terms that express the different audiences and, so to speak, the different beneficiaries of each. In the writerly, exploratory phase, you focus your attention on developing and sorting out your ideas; you allow your ideas to change as they take shape, even if they contradict what you said two sentences before. You never know quite where this kind of writing will lead: you are pursuing an insight — on a voyage of discovery, an expedition into the unknown — and the more surprising and new the revelations, the better.

In the readerly phase, you focus attention on your reader. You try to see your writing through the reader’s eyes, to imagine what those eyes will see as they work their way through your text and how the mind behind those eyes will respond. You arrange your arguments in the most effective order; you delete sentences, paragraphs, even whole pages that do not belong; you add new material where something is missing; you iron out wrinkled sentences and find apt words to replace awkward ones. You carefully craft a text designed to persuade readers to believe, think, feel, or do something.

Even if lots of good ideas have already occurred to you as a result of rereading and taking notes, it would be unwise to skip the exploratory, writerly phase. It truly is the energy center of the writing process, the most creative and, for many, the most enjoyable of writing activities. As novelist and screenwriter Evan Hunter said, “The only true creative aspect of writing is the first draft. That’s when it comes straight from your head and your heart. . . . The rest is donkey work. It is, however, donkey work that has to be done.”[^2] Devoting adequate time to working out and developing your ideas — thinking and rethinking them — will result in a final product that is clearer, richer, and more interesting. Informal writing enables you to correct weaknesses that were previously invisible and to become aware of possibilities that at first you could not have imagined. Moreover, low-stakes experimentation with words and strategies smoothes out the whole writing process, reducing the anxiety that can otherwise be overwhelming. It supplies the raw material, the ingredients, that you need for the readerly phase that comes later.



There are, of course, many kinds of writerly, informal writing—journaling, note-taking, planning, and so on. This chapter focuses on exploratory writing for the purpose of developing ideas, a pleasurable and unpressured kind of writing in which there are few rules and no wrong moves. Exploratory writing can feel more like play than work. It gives you the opportunity to puzzle things out, to delve deeper, in a writing space where no one will judge or criticize you. You can freely exercise your creativity and ingenuity, because at this stage even apparently outlandish ideas are just fine. You can safely write about your personal thoughts and experiences too. You can worry later about whether to keep such material in your final paper; for now, just explore. This is writing for no one’s eyes but your own.

The twentieth-century English novelist E. M. Forster famously posed the question, “How can I tell what I think until I see what I say?” [^3] At first, this may seem counterintuitive: Doesn’t thinking come before writing? But what Forster describes is a familiar experience to writers: somehow the act of putting ideas into a sequence of words and arranging words in a sequence of sentences reveals and clarifies what we think. We can begin writing with very little sense of what we might have to say about a subject and can use the writing process as a tool for discovery, figuring things out as we go.

Most of us talk to ourselves — if not out loud, then silently. We speak thoughts in our heads in order to consider and test them; we might even improvise a little debate to weigh the pros and cons of an idea. But usually we don’t sustain these interior conversations for very long, and we end up with no record of the conversation except unreliable memory. Recording thoughts in writing makes it possible to see these thoughts—quite literally—and to work with them. As the teacher and scholar Peter Elbow writes, “A principal value of language . . . is that it permits you to distance yourself from your own perceptions, feelings, and thoughts. Try, then, to write words on paper so as to permit an interaction between you and not-you. You are building someone to talk to.”[^4] Seeing our words makes it possible not only to weigh them but also to respond to them — to improve and extend them — so that writing leads to more writing. Thus writing does not merely express thinking; it produces thinking (from the Latin *producere,* “to lead forward”).

Many writers enjoy exploratory writing enormously. Their thoughts about scholarly matters and private matters get mixed up together — and this has the effect of enriching and deepening both. Some writers prefer to write longhand, in small notebooks or on blank pages of copier paper; others prefer to type their thoughts on a computer. Many prefer to work somewhere quiet, where there’s nothing to distract them — no phone or TV or e-mail. Other writers work best in crowded, noisy environments like cafés or fast-food restaurants, where the music and chatter become a kind of white noise that actually helps them think. Some people need the comfort and privacy of a special writing place — a bedroom or an office. Personalities differ; the important thing is to figure out by experimentation where you do your best work, and then make a habit of going there regularly.

### Knots and Questions
With time, writers tend to develop individual methods of exploratory writing to suit their own personalities and situation (such as the particular requirements of an assignment or a project), but the variations typically follow a basic pattern. In all exploratory writing, two types of activity are of particular value: posing questions and playing with “knots.” A knot is anything that’s puzzling or unclear or even mysterious about the text (or whatever is on your mind) — some difficulty, something that bothers you about it. We’re all familiar with crime dramas in which the detective fastens onto some detail that doesn’t quite make sense—the butler’s shoes weren’t muddy—and of course it leads to the solution of the whole mystery: the butler was innocent of murder, after all; it was the baron’s estranged half-sister who did it! That little detail is the knot that the detective plays with until it unravels and reveals the truth. A knot might at first look like an awkward inconvenience: a fact that doesn’t quite fit with the theory. But knots are frequently doorways to fresh, surprising ways of looking at something. Once you’ve identified a knot, either from memory or from your notes, toy with it, untangle it, see where it leads you. Be patient: if you just pull randomly on the end of a string, you might only make the knot tighter. Exploratory writing offers the opportunity to approach it with a light touch, to get the knot to yield by taking time to analyze it, prod it, gently interrogate it. It’s possible the knot leads nowhere — but it might lead to a whole new way of seeing things.

Questions are the best tool we have not only for undoing knots but also for finding them. Knots can be hard to identify at first, but questions are easy to come by. We can always pose some kind of question to get things started, even if it seems obvious or pointless. The writing process gives us an opportunity to rephrase, correct, or sharpen the question, and a well-crafted question clears a pathway to a good idea. One question leads to another, and a good idea leads to further questions.

We sometimes speak of “entertaining” a question, a turn of phrase that suggests precisely what is needed: invite the question in, offer it a cup of tea, urge it to sit down and chat. Worthwhile questions can’t be turned away immediately with a simple yes or no answer. They demand our hospitality before they divulge everything they know. To use a different metaphor, questions function as the engine of the whole process: they keep the exploration moving forward into new territory. If you get to the point where your exploratory writing hits a dead end or seems to peter out, try simply listing questions for a while. Compile a dozen questions and then choose one to work with until it opens up further questions.

## Sample Exploratory Writing
First-year student Lea Bright is working on an essay assignment with an open topic. In these exploratory writing sessions, she thinks through the meaning and possible implications of some themes from Emily Esfahani Smith’s “Life on the Island” (p. 000), focusing on some of the more promising knots and questions in the essay as she looks for a topic and some ideas to write about.

### Session 1, October 12, 2014
I think the main point here is that people don’t do so well in places like America where individualism is so strongly emphasized. Strong communities are needed for good psychological health, and they’re becoming weaker, even though most people today live in cities surrounded by other people. People can be very lonely and unhappy in cities. American culture is becoming “hyper-individualistic” and narcissistic, she says, and that’s dangerous because it leads to higher suicide rates and presumably a lot of unhappiness.

I guess the main question I have right now is whether it’s really true that America has become hyper-individualistic and narcissistic. I agree that narcissism is bad, but is social isolation really on the rise? “Our connections to others are slowly dissolving,” she says. That doesn’t feel quite true to me personally, but I suppose as a college student, my case might be pretty different from the norm. She says that middle-aged suicide has been rising. Levels of anxiety are rising.

The strange thing is that we’re so much more connected now than just a few years ago. Esfahani Smith was writing in 2013 — only a year ago — so people had exactly the same phones and technology then, and they could text and call each other all the time, the same as today. I suppose the point, though, is that texting and calling someone doesn’t necessarily make them a confidant, and she seems to be saying that the number of confidants is falling. In 1985, the most common response was three; in 2004, the most common response was zero. It’s possible, then, that some people have a lot of confidants, but a lot of people have none — more people than in 1985? (Not quite sure how this works.)

I wonder if it’s true that song lyrics today are more narcissistic than they used to be. I could check it out by comparing the lyrics of the top hits right now
to the lyrics of top hits ten, twenty, thirty, even forty years ago. I think that would be possible.

### Session 2, October 13, 2014
On second reading, I think I have a better sense of the argument that she’s making about individualism. Conservatives, she says, tend to think that individualism is a great thing and one of the things that makes America a great country. I think Esfahani Smith is saying to them: “Yes, individualism is okay, but hyper-individualism can be really bad: people need friends and communities too.” So conservatives should be careful about emphasizing individualism at the expense of community, or maybe about supposing that community is always a nonconservative value, a liberal value, and something they would naturally oppose.

I can’t get super interested in the conservative-liberal thing, though. And I’m not sure I believe song lyrics are going to make a strong case one way or the other. What I couldn’t stop thinking about as I reread the essay was the role that smart phones and social media play in all this. Maybe smart phones make us more disconnected from each other, in a way, rather than more connected?

I was thinking about all those times when good conversations have gotten interrupted by calls or texts. Even on the phone: “There’s someone on the other line.” It’s perfectly possible to have a deep conversation, of course, but it just seems like phones make it harder, and they’re always with us. Theoretically, they make connections with others easier — and they actually do in many ways — but the connections they make never seem to be very deep. You need to be face to face, or if on the phone, then uninterrupted, to have a deep connection with someone, and phones maybe make that harder, actually. I could write about this from personal experience — and probably the experience of my friends. Will that be enough? It would be great to come up with some neat way of getting evidence like the Google Ngram Viewer. I’ll have to think about that.

Maybe we just need to learn how to use our devices better. They’re not necessarily good or bad in themselves: as users we do have control. We have to turn off our phones in class. Why can’t we learn to turn them off in social situations? Maybe we need a movement! Anyway, I’m not sure why Esfahani Smith doesn’t talk about technology in the essay, but I think it could be a good topic. I think my starting point could be the General Social Survey that Esfahani Smith cites, and the decline in the number of confidants that people have. And so that raises the whole question of whether or not phones and social media actually make it less likely that friends will become confidants, or more so. And if they do make it less likely, can we turn it around somehow so that they make it more likely? It’s probably complicated, but it’s interesting.

## Checklist for Exploratory Writing
Just as computers and pens are the physical tools for exploratory writing, so knots and questions are the mental tools. But we still need some practical guidelines for this kind of writing. Here, then, is a list. Keep in mind, however, that these are only guidelines. Eventually, you’ll develop an exploratory writing practice of your own that might work differently.

- [ ] Remember that this writing is for your eyes only.
- No one will read it except you, unless you choose to show it to someone.
Plan to write steadily for a set period.

- Try twenty minutes at first. But fiftee nminutes or thirty minutes will work too.
In any case, decide on your time frame in advance.

- [ ] To start with, put your notes aside and work from memory.
- What you remember is probably what interests you most: for some reason, it
got lodged in your mind.

- [ ] If nothing occurs to you from memory, begin anywhere.
- You may have nothing to say at first. You may have nothing to say for the full
writing period. That’s okay. Just write “I can’t think of anything to say. I still can’t think of anything to say” until something occurs to you, however trivial or superficial it might seem. Thoughts are stirring in the back of your mind. When something about the reading or the problem does strike you, write about it.

- [ ] Keep moving forward.
- Don’t edit. Don’t worry about grammar, spelling, punctuation, or formatting.

- [ ] Don’t go back and erase or cross out anything you’ve written, no matter how pointless or silly it seems.

- [ ] Entertain questions and knots.
- However silly or inappropriate they may seem, use them as the engines of
exploration. Dwell on knots. Stay for as long as possible with the knots that you come across — anything that’s puzzling or interesting. Do what you can with them. One may lead to another or begin to change its appearance as you dwell on it.
- [ ] Open a space for reflection.
- Talk things out. Speculate freely. Ponder. Give yourself time to focus at length.
- [ ] Put away your dictionary and thesaurus for now.
- Use your own words, even if they may not be exactly right. Save perfectionism
for the readerly phase.
- [ ] Expect a lot of garbage in this writing.
- That’s exactly as it should be. You need to generate a lot of material in order to
produce a few good ideas.

### The Benefits of Writing Daily
This book or any book can teach you only so much about writing. Writing is a craft, and crafts are learned by doing. Like learning to play the piano or paint or jump hurdles, learning to write means doing it regularly, and writers benefit from  practice more than anything else. Instruction is helpful, but we learn far more from sitting down regularly to put words on paper, discovering over time our themes and our voices, steadily gaining confidence and fluency, recognizing our strengths and limitations, developing an ear for what works and what’s labored or florid or wordy, getting a sense of how to begin, how to keep going, how to finish.

## Practicing Exploratory Writing
###Option 1.
Try your hand at exploratory writing. Go to your college library or another quiet spot where you can work without interruption. Briefly review the notes that you have made on one of the readings included in this book. Then open your notebook to a new page and write for twenty minutes. Search for a good theme for an essay, on any topic related to the reading. If you find one before twenty minutes are up, don’t stop: continue to explore the theme, testing its strengths and weaknesses and developing its implications.
### Option 2.
As a subject for exploratory writing, consider this painting by René Magritte, entitled The Liberator (1947). Try to work out an interpretation: What, in your view, is the painting saying? What does it mean? Devote thirty to forty-five minutes of exploratory writing to this activity. The Liberator (1947), by René Magritte. (Source: © 2014 C. Herscovici/Artists Rights Society [ARS], New York)
###Option 3.
Choose an intriguing poem, photograph, painting, or piece of music as a subject for exploratory writing. (Choose one to which you have access so that you do not have to rely on memory and can examine it repeatedly.) It should be a work that is unfamiliar to you so that your exploration of it has a chance to yield fresh and unexpected insights.

### Guidelines Keeping the Censor at Bay
To avoid the negative thinking that blocks writing, keep the following guidelines
in mind:
- Recognize that the negative, critical voice in your head is the enemy of creativity and insight.
- Write daily in a journal for no one’s eyes but your own. Write whatever you want.
- Permit yourself to write badly in your journal.
- Relax. Go where your mind takes you and enjoy the ride.

Although this book deals with writing in academic settings, we strongly encourage you to write a daily journal about whatever you like. Use a notebook or, if you prefer, a computer, and save your entries in a special folder. Write two or three pages a day — and write every day, preferably at a regular time. (The best time is probably soon after you get up, before your busy life eats up the rest of the day.) This journal will be for your eyes only, with no restrictions on what you write about. Though journals are often used for recording experiences, feelings, and speculations, they don’t have to be. You can write stories or dreams or fantasies, describe what’s around you wherever you happen to be, or just write aimlessly about nothing in particular. It’s all perfectly fine. Any kind of daily writing will help you become a more proficient writer. (In fact, the word “journal” comes from an Old French word meaning “daily.”)

Writer and teacher Julia Cameron notes that creative people (and that might be virtually everyone) tend to be highly self-critical.

>We are victims of our own internalized perfectionist, a nasty internal and eternal critic, the Censor, who resides in our (left) brain and keeps up a constant stream of subversive remarks that are often disguised as the truth. The Censor says wonderful things like: ‘You call that writing? What a joke. You can’t even punctuate. If you haven’t done it by now you never will. You can’t even spell. What makes you think
you can be creative?’ And on and on.[^5]

Daily journal writing helps us learn to ignore the Censor’s negative and disabling voice. We can let that voice carp away, while we just keep on writing whatever we feel like writing. In time, we learn that the Censor is merely a “blocking device”[^6] that serves no useful function, and it slowly loses its power over us.

## Making Meanings
As a college student, you are likely to find journaling particularly valuable because you are bombarded throughout the day with so many new ideas, experiences, and people. You need not only a place to record your impressions but also a way to sort it all out. Ideas and questions occur to you constantly, but you need to take the time to reflect, develop these thoughts, and dwell with them.

Ideas become meaningful to us when we find a way to integrate them into our entire body of knowledge. As long as they float around in a space where they are cut off from the rest of our concerns and experiences, they will never be very meaningful. Notebooks, journals, “morning pages,” free writing—all these are forms of “heuristic” writing, or writing to discover. Done in a sincere and committed way, they become the means of discovering not just ideas but meanings, not just thesis statements and arguments but connections between the readings and your own interests. Too often, schoolwork assigned by instructors in different courses that have little in common exists in isolation, detached from students’ actual experiences and questions. One of the most effective ways of making readings and assignments meaningful is to begin by writing for yourself, rather than writing for a grade. Ultimately, the two things can merge so that the writing you do for yourself evolves into the writing you submit for a grade. Exploratory writing can function as the bridge between the two, the means by which schoolwork can become personally meaningful and satisfying.

Exploratory writing is *recursive,* meaning that the results of one session become the starting point for the next. This writing strategy is sometimes called looping, a rhythm of writing and resting, of tension and relaxation, that helps ideas
to form. Here’s how it works:
- Write for ten, twenty, or thirty minutes. Take a break,roughly equal to the amount of time you’ve spent writing. Pick up a promising thread from the writing you just completed, and write for another ten, twenty, or thirty minutes. Then take another break. Keep this going for several loops.
- Enjoy yourself. Don’t hesitate to explore thoughts that you don’t expect to include in the finished version of your paper. You never know what may spark an idea, so trust your thoughts and let them lead you forward.

The results of exploratory writing are frequently surprising. You might start out in one direction and find yourself suddenly veering off in a different one altogether, and this new direction takes you places you never imagined going.

You might write something on Monday that seems unremarkable and insignificant, but when it comes to mind on Wednesday, it opens up all kinds of unforeseen possibilities, becoming the beginning of a whole new line of inquiry. In her essay “On Keeping a Notebook,” essayist and novelist Joan Didion explores the purpose of the notes that she has been taking—regularly but unsystematically—for many years. Their value, it turns out, is less in what she actually records on paper than in the memories that these notes can conjure up.

>At no point have I ever been able successfully to keep a diary; . . . and on those few occasions when I have tried dutifully to record a day’s events, boredom has so overcome me that the results are mysterious at best. What is this business about “shopping, typing piece, dinner with E, depressed”? . . .
>In fact I have abandoned altogether that kind of pointless entry; instead I tell what some would call lies. “That’s simply not true,” the members of my family frequently tell me when they come up against my memory of a shared event. “The party was not for you, the spider was not a black widow, it wasn’t that way at all.” Very likely they are right, for not only have I always had trouble distinguishing between what happened and what merely might have happened, but I remain unconvinced that the distinction, for my purposes, matters. . . .
>How it felt to me: that is getting closer to the truth about a notebook. I sometimes delude myself about why I keep a notebook, imagine that some thrifty virtue derives from preserving everything observed. . . . Remember what it was to be me: that is always the point.7

Likewise, the point of exploratory writing is always to find out what something means to you. Don’t expect any sort of heuristic writing to pay off quickly: most of the time, you won’t arrive at the insight or thesis statement that you need for your essay with your very first writing session — or even your second. The process is meant to be recursive. The result of the first session becomes the starting point for the next one. You may be surprised how many sessions you have time for. If you have five days between reading/note-taking and revising/polishing, and if you devote just ninety minutes a day to exploratory writing, broken into three sessions, you will complete fifteen half-hour sessions. At three pages per session, that’s forty-five pages of exploratory writing. More to the point, it’s a journey that may lead you far from your point of departure and, in all likelihood, toward ideas of real value.

## You Can Always Write More
One of the most valuable outcomes of exploratory writing is the effect it will have on your attitude toward revision. When writing feels difficult and demands enormous effort, writers tend to become too attached to their words. They become reluctant to cut or revise passages that, no matter how much perspiration they cost or how delightful they may be in themselves, really must go, for the greater good of the whole. By contrast, writers who know from experience that they can readily generate more writing whenever it’s needed can revise with confidence and can revise more effectively, because they are willing to abandon material. To revise well, we need to know that our words are not so very precious: we can always write more. As the late British comic Spike Milligan used to say: “Ingle jingle jangle jom / There’s more, my friend, where that came from.”8 And as, more soberly, Annie Dillard writes: “the path is not the work.”9 The writing that we abandon was useful for getting us where we need to be, but once it has served its purpose, we must be willing to part with it. Perhaps every writer finds this process of deleting words and ideas a little difficult to do, but the habit of exploratory writing and unpressured drafting does make it easier. We no longer feel that words are precious, hard-to-find things but instead feel that they are plentiful and easy to come by. We can afford to be generous with them.

## Focused Exploratory Writing
As we’ve seen, exploratory writing can serve many purposes and be about anything at all. But there will be times when you’ll want to use exploratory writing to make progress toward completing an academic essay. For the purpose of academic writing, first focus on figuring out exactly what the question or problem or issue is. Once you’ve got a clear sense of that, you can begin to work on finding a solution to it.

Focused exploratory writing is useful whether you are writing in response to a specific assignment—perhaps one that presents you with a specific question or problem to address — or writing on a topic of your own. Even if the assignment is phrased as a question or problem rather than a topic or a directive, first you’ll need to understand the question for yourself, in your own terms and in relation to your own thinking. Patiently thinking the question through—figuring out what it’s really asking, what it’s getting at — is the first and most necessary step toward arriving at an answer.

If the assignment asks you to respond to a particular reading, begin by focusing on the problem that the author is addressing. The author may explicitly mention the problem (usually in the opening paragraphs), or you may have to infer it from the text by asking, “What sort of question, problem, or issue does the author’s argument shed light on or take a stand on?”

Then, work out your take on the problem. Explain, in as much detail as possible, where you stand and where the author stands. Do you agree or disagree with the author? Your sense of this may be vague at first, and it may shift or even reverse itself as you write, but that’s fine: you’re just exploring, not laying out a consistent argument.
Pose questions whenever they occur to you. Questions help you see more clearly where you need to direct attention; they will move you forward.

## Practicing Exploratory Freewriting
The following activities will give you the opportunity to try your hand at exploratory freewriting, to get the feel of it, and to experience how it works. For now, follow the guidelines that have been offered in this chapter. To get more practice with exploratory freewriting, choose one or more of these activities. Before you begin, decide how much time you will devote to the activity you’ve chosen, and divide it into segments of ten, fifteen, or twenty minutes so that you can practice looping.

### Option 1: Focused Exploratory Writing for an Essay Assignment.
If you have been assigned a topic for a paper, use it as a springboard. Read over the assignment instructions carefully. Consider the following questions as you write.
- What is the assignment asking you to do? What central problem does it set for you? Paraphrase the problem as you see it (put it into your own words).
- What can you say in response to this problem as a result of your reading, note-taking, and thinking so far? Work first from memory, but if you get stuck, turn to your notes.
- What passage in the text speaks most directly to the problem given in the assignment? What does this passage say (paraphrase it)? Explain the connection to the problem, as you see it. What conclusions can you draw from this passage? What ideas does it suggest to you?
- What other passages relate to the problem? What do they say? Repeat the step above for each relevant passage: paraphrase it, explain how it relates to the problem, develop the ideas it suggests to you.
- What seems to be the purpose of the assignment? Why might this problem be important? How does it relate to the course and its objectives?
- Does the assignment offer any clues as to the direction your essay should take? Many assignments include both a directive — a statement of what you must
do — and suggestions or hints for things you might do, or might want to think about, as you develop your ideas.

### Option 2: Exegesis and Commentary.
As we said earlier, exegesis is an explanation or interpretation of a text. For this activity, choose a short passage from the text — between two sentences and one paragraph in length. (You might work with one of the essays included in this book or use a text that you’ve been assigned in your coursework.) It should be a passage that seems important to the meaning of the text as a whole but also contains difficulties or puzzles of some kind — in other words, a passage that seems likely to reward close attention, one that’s worth dwelling on for a while.

Begin by stating in your own words what you think the passage means. Try
to clarify any parts that seem obscure. (You may need a dictionary; if so, quote useful definitions in your writing.) Work over the passage in detail, so that
your writing unfolds its meaning as exhaustively as possible. Consider how its parts work together, how words, phrases, and sentences relate to one another to form a meaningful whole. Stay alert for meanings that might not have been obvious at first, especially ones that differ from — or even contradict — your first impression.

Once you have done all you can with the passage itself and have completed your exegesis, shift your focus to making connections between the passage and something else — other texts, ideas, experiences, and facts. (In the exegesis phase of this activity, you work inside the passage; in the commentary phase, you work between the passage and something else.) Almost any kind of connection could produce a useful insight. How does your chosen passage relate to the major themes of the text as a whole? How does it relate to particular passages in the text that seem memorable or important? What connections do you find between this passage and other things in the world, such as your experiences or other texts you’ve read or social issues or political events?

After writing about one or two connections of this kind, go back to the text and consider it in isolation once more. What more do you see in it now?

### Option 3: Exploratory Writing on a Knot of Your Own Choosing.
Use some problem or puzzle in your own work or life as a subject for exploratory writing. You may or may not solve the problem, but write continuously and explore different ways of looking at it. Try to bring greater clarity to the problem, and perhaps some kind of solution will emerge — if not immediately, then later on.
Option 4: Freewriting. Try freewriting without any subject or starting point at all. See what emerges as you follow where the writing takes you. As you proceed, try to identify a topic, a question, or a problem. Articulate and refine it to the best of your ability, and try to develop some kind of insight into it. Use the looping technique to get some distance and perspective on your topic between bouts of writing.

Next, begin working out your reasons for your position. If you get stuck, work on key passages (a few sentences) in the text. Perhaps copy out the most relevant ones, or ones that feel like knots, and focus on answering these questions:
- What is the author saying in this passage?
- What might it have to do with the problem?
- How does it relate to my position?

Keep it loose: you are not yet writing for anyone’s eyes but your own. The trick to exploratory writing is to keep moving toward your objective even though you don’t know what it looks like. Move toward the articulation of an idea, or the framing of a question, or the formulation of an argument. Eventually, perhaps repeatedly, you will find that the elements of your puzzle resolve themselves in a little “aha” experience as something obscure emerges into clarity. Then you’ve got something. This something may not be the final thing—ideas can always be polished, developed, elaborated, refined — but it’s a beginning.

## Checklist for Focused Exploratory Writing
Keep the following points in mind as you write to discover and develop ideas.

<input type="checkbox" name="problem"> <label for="problem">Identify the problem, issue, or question that the assignment or text addresses.</label>

<input type="checkbox" name="position"> <label for="position">Establish your own position and seek a solution or an answer. Make a contribution to the conversation.</label>

<input type="checkbox" name="reasons"> <label for="reasons">List your reasons or justification for this stand.</label>
- Pose questions.
- Seek knots.

There he posits it as the words of “an old lady” who refuses to believe in logic and would agree with the French novelist André Gide, whose book *Les Faux Monnayeurs* (1925) tries to do away with plot and replace it with “real life.” Forster is doubtful about the wisdom of this approach. Nevertheless, the question has often been adopted by writing teachers as a succinct expression of the aims of exploratory writing.
